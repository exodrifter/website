To use the scripts in `tasks` which fetch data from Vimeo, first create a file
in the root of the project named `env.json` with the following contents

```json
{
    "client_id": "<secret>",
    "client_secret": "<secret>",
    "access_token": "<secret>"
}
```

Replace `<secret>` with the appropriate values.
