<p>I'm <b>exodrifter</b> (she/her), an indie game developer, vtuber, and functional programmer based in Austin, Texas. I love yuri, space, and heavy board games. I'm always trying to make games that connect with people in emotional and meaningful ways.</p>

I'm currently working as an indie game developer making games in Godot, much of it live on Twitch. In the past, I've worked in the logistics industry as a Haskell developer and in the dataviz and archviz industry as a Unity VR developer. In college, I was the President of the student-run game development club Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS) at The University of Texas at Austin during the school year of 2013-2014.
