In Godot 4.3.stable, I set `color_ramp` to a different gradient on `GPUParticles3D` but it wasn't changing the color of the emitted particles. It wasn't until I watched [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtJJVjjM_-Q&t=143s) that I noticed the `vertex_color_use_as_albedo` property on the draw pass material needs to be set to true.

After double-checking the documentation, I notice that it does indeed note this:

> Note: `color_ramp` multiplies the particle mesh's vertex colors. To have a visible effect on a `BaseMaterial3D`, `BaseMaterial3D.vertex_color_use_as_albedo` must be true. For a `ShaderMaterial`, `ALBEDO *= COLOR.rgb`; must be inserted in the shader's `fragment()` function. Otherwise, `color_ramp` will have no visible effect.

Updating the settings of the material in the particle effect's draw pass fixes the issue.
