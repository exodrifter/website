Working on _no signal_ offline.
- Copied TODOs from [20250706001131](20250706001131.md)
- The game is coming out soon, and there are a few bugs I still need to fix.
- I've also noticed some bugs that influencers/press have run into as well, so the bug list is a bit longer compared to the last log entry.
- Also, I need to increment the version number to 1.x for release anyway.
- Unfortunately, the way godot handles transparency is a little frustrating and I wasn't able to replace the old wordmark with the new one.

TODO:
- [x] Change beginning prompt to say "press any button" instead of "click to continue"
- [x] You can keep the drive bay UI open ~~somehow~~ by resetting the camera while the UI is open
- [x] The letter is always visible in the pause menu
- [ ] ~~The letter spins too quickly on some systems~~ Unable to replicate this bug
- [x] Probe cinematic is too dark
- [ ] Old wordmark still shows up in the credits of the game
