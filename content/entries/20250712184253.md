Trying to figure out why my website doesn't appear to be responsive on my phone or when I enter responsive design mode in the Firefox developer inspector, despite the fact that I designed it to be responsive and it works fine on my laptop.

When I resize my viewport to a smaller size, the size of the body gets stuck at a large value even though the inspector says the viewport is much smaller than that. Checking through the CSS code, I don't see any obvious places where I might be causing this to happen.

I talked to a friend about this and they pointed out that I was missing the viewport meta tag:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Adding this node to the `head` element fixes the problem. Thanks Mia!

I'm wondering what exactly it means when the tag is *missing*. Looking up documentation on the viewport tag gives a clue:

> When a page is not made responsive for smaller viewports it looks bad or even breaks on a smaller screen. To fix this problem introduce a responsive tag to control the viewport. This tag was first introduced by Apple Inc. for Safari iOS.

It looks like this is yet another backwards-compatible fix for web pages. However, I was unable to determine if there is a standard on how browsers should behave if it is missing.
