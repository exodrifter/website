- [ ] ~~Fix rendering glitch in black hole shader, possibly due to wrong precision number being used somewhere.~~ This bug appears in the original code, see [ebruneton/black_hole_shader#1](https://github.com/ebruneton/black_hole_shader/issues/1). It may be a driver issue, since it doesn't appear on all systems and when it does appear it doesn't always look the same between machines. Some chatters with Nvidia cards were able to run without seeing the discontinuity, while AMD users saw the discontinuity.

- [ ] Sometimes the anchor point is wrong when you select an item, not sure how to reproduce.
- [ ] Maybe we should color coordinate drives and computers? I didn't like it when I did this before, but maybe I could approach the problem in a different way... Also, the colors would mostly be useful for people who don't read but I'm designing a game that depends a lot on reading.
- [ ] Auto-select first empty slot when clicking on drive bays
- [ ] Add previews to audio settings
- [ ] Show button on screen when camera is in stair or door region
