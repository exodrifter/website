Music lesson
- Listening to my track *undeterred*
	- It doesn't sound like mathcore, but it sounds good.
	- It's very good at evoking a particular emotion
	- Sounds like it would be in the Phantasy Star Online soundtrack
	- It would sound more like mathcore if it had a more pronounced bass that didn't sustain the notes all the time.
- Listening to [*Tigran Hamasyan - The Curse*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxyFWewUvA0)
	- Complex rhythms are often played on the same note
	- It still occasionally travels around
	- Very riff-based
	- The bass and drums are locked together when the bass is playing low
- What if I tried to keep in mind what i want to say in my next album for my next attempt in making a song? What use can I find for these rhythms to tell something?
