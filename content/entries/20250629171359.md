Streaming this on Twitch.

When I was at OffKai, I was thinking about some of my ideas for making the stream better over the last year. I want to get an updated VTuber avatar, but I'll experiment with some ideas for that on Tuesday. Today, I want to consider the stream overlay:

- What is the overall vibe? Motivating, Cool, Productive
- I'm okay with aspects that have dry humor
- Virtual environment (like YukieVT and mdxcai)
- Start doing 1080p streams
- Interactive elements \*
	- I am bad at coming up with these, please help me with this
	- "Ask a question popup" When a question is asked using a redeem, add it to a queue. Have a special "answering booth" scene for answering questions maybe.
	- Let people submit items to a news ticker
	- "wrap up tangent" redeem
- Automatic interactive elements
	- For example:
		- If there is a tv in the background you could change the channel
		- If there is radio in the background, you could change the station
	- Creative ideas:
		- (high effort) We can add a piano (or some other music instrument) in the background that people can play music on
			- for input: text like bezelea bells? midi URL download? **turtle programming moves on a grid?**
	- Spawn emotes (like in sky or like in the old overlay)
	- Attendance redeems
	- Let the audience control the camera placement
	- Let audience spawn some kind of temporary item into the scene
	- Pun counter
- Camera controls
- No annoying stuff/things I don't like
	- Throwables are annoying
	- Soundboards are annoying
	- Don't feel comfortable with headpats redeem
	- No skinner box games
- Want to find a way to use bits
- SAMMI-style chat/guests voice chat popup
- (high effort) For coworking streams, have a global task list that people can add, modify, and check off their own tasks in. Maybe add a way for people to submit the work they did for review on stream.
	- Add a scene where you can see everyone who is currently working
	- Let people define their own avatars
- Add a place to show currently playing music

Talking about the virtual environment now
- For style, I want my vtuber avatar to wear "cyber wear/tech wear", so it seems we are probably going to go for a cyberpunk aesthetic
	- Hiroto Ikeuchi
- I want the weather to be stormy, because I like storms. I want this kind of window in the background https://www.tumblr.com/someday-dreamlands/733251282970804224?source=share
- Fanart wall?
- Add a glass dry erase board that I can draw on when explaining things, use IK to move the hand around?
