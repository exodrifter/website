Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250103194331](20250103194331.md)
- Made build v0.31 today

TODO:
- [x] Fix EVA launch button not transitioning to cinematic scene
- [x] Make a new build

Sounds:
- [ ] probe assembly sounds
- [ ] Add dripping sounds to bathroom
- [ ] Add audio when hovering over door or keypad https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/0/6857382246109938235/
- [ ] Move sounds for chess
- [ ] Capture sounds for chess

Content:
- [ ] i forgot to include neveah's thrust calculation for the probe in the office and as a requirement in the EVA
- [ ] Add more shark plushies
- [ ] Add shark plushie collection spot in Naoko's room
- [ ] Add more dialog to work rooms
- [ ] Add more puzzles to work rooms
- [ ] Add clue to office about which lab the lockbox is in
- [ ] Add a way for the player to know what the cards look like before they go looking for one? https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/0/4703538708011162084/#c4703539342753139244
- [ ] Add a clue to tell the player where to go after the communications room
- [ ] Make toilets flushable
- [ ] Add a hint somewhere that all of the sequences are the same on all of the cards
- [ ] Add a paper slip showing all of the card sequence roots
- [ ] Add ability to slide circuit buttons

Unsure:
- [ ] ~~People tend to double click on things, which cancels the camera movement. Maybe I can detect double clicks and handle them?~~ The ability to toggle the orbit button is a control which overlaps with this, so I think it might be more complicated to support both than is worth.
- [ ] Add a map button
- [ ] [#15](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/15) Add OCR for handwritten notes
- [ ] [#16](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/16) Item highlight assist mode
- [ ] [#44](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/44) Controller support
- [ ] I could break the cassette tapes sometimes, which means you need to manually re-wind the tape back into the cassette.
- [ ] Add gamma control so that players can adjust brightness
- [ ] Sometimes the anchor point is wrong when you select an item, not sure how to reproduce.
- [ ] Maybe we should color coordinate drives and computers? I didn't like it when I did this before, but maybe I could approach the problem in a different way... Also, the colors would mostly be useful for people who don't read but I'm designing a game that depends a lot on reading.
- [ ] Auto-select first empty slot when clicking on drive bays
- [ ] Add previews to audio settings
- [ ] Show button on screen when camera is in stair or door region
