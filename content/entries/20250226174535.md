Music lesson, talking about _last night's nightmare_:
- I don't like the intro very much, teacher suggested two choices I could do to improve this:
	- Drop the lyrics
	- Repeat the last line
- I feel like the song feels too structured and rigid
	- Teacher feels like it works with the theme of the lyrics
	- We could make it feel less locked in if there was more dynamic contrast, like during the bridge
- We could make the ending feel bigger and more satisfying
	- Could add a saw by creating a high end fill, to improve the dynamic contrast
	- Add another instrument when the chorus repeats, doing an octave double
	- Add another vocal when the chorus repeats, doing an octave double or a melody
	- Add a drum fill in the first measure of the progression
	- Consider adding a tom to the drum pattern, like an 80s tom
