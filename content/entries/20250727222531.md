Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250726205113](20250726205113.md)
- Got more bug reports from players

TODO:
- [x] You should not be able to access "real" items in PGEIST scenes
- [ ] Make the piano puzzle easier?
- [x] See if Tanuki can help fix the center visual clipping "bug"
- [ ] ~~Fix rubber banding when moving after clicking on something when smoothing is turned off~~ Can't replicate this anymore?

Probably won't fix:
- [ ] Old wordmark still shows up in the credits of the game
- [ ] [#62](https://git.tsuki.games/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/62) Game freeze when accessing the EVA computer
- [ ] Another player ran into the deltatime not being accounted for correctly for the envelope in the wordmark [20250725022444](20250725022444.md)
- [ ] A player reported a lighting issue in the center, where it loads in completely dark while playing a game. Reloading the game fixes the issue.
