Watching [demo playthrough](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2280267336) by `Outfrost`:
- [ ] Look sensitivity setting is missing
- [ ] You can drag the settings view while dragging a slider
- [ ] Use up/down controls to navigate between rows in card writer
- [ ] Keep anchor hidden after WASD movement until anchor is set again
- [ ] Maybe reduce volume of all sounds? Maybe just the safe keypad
- [ ] WASD left/right controls don't go to next row in card writer when at the end or beginning of a row
- [ ] Decorative lights for elevator room near the door should be green instead of red
- [ ] Elevator chamber shutters are visible when door is open
