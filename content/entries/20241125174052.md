Found out today that apparently Godot _is_ in fact capable of exporting zips on build. Previously, I was zipping the builds manually using a script. However, if you just change `export_path` to a `.zip` file, then Godot will zip the build for you.

For example, I previously had the path `../bin/linux-no-signal.x86_64` for my Linux build. Changing this to `../bin/linux-no-signal.zip` zips the executable for me. In fact, on Windows, it will zip the executable with the executable bit set which would otherwise be lost if I exported the `.x86_64` file and then zipped it manually later.
