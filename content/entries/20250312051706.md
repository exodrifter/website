Just wanted to write a few notes about the ATX Game Makers Showcase which happened just a few days ago. I attended it as an exhibitor in 2024 ([202403102110](202403102110.md)) and 2025 ([20250309163842](20250309163842.md), [20250310163053](20250310163053.md)). Both times, I showed _no signal_. It takes place during SXSW at Valhalla in Austin, Texas.

In 2024, it was called the "3rd Annual ATX Game Makers Showcase and Arcade" and was named "4th Annual ATX Game Makers Showcase" in 2025.
