Music lesson:
- Talking about mastering, since I want to release and album on the 22nd.
- There are two different kinds of loudness: dB (actual) and LUFS (percieved)
- higher frequencies are perceived as louder.
- Streaming platforms will want -14 LUFS, otherwise they'll modify the audio to match that.
- You can measure LUFS with a plugin, like [Youlean](https://youlean.co/youlean-loudness-meter/)
- -14 might sound too soft, could try doing -12.
- For a maximizer, recommends using the ozone maximizer.
- When mastering something, turn the entire mix by -2dB. This gives you some room to make some frequencies louder instead of all of them.
- For EQ, recommends using fabfilter.
- Increase the volume of frequencies that are not loud enough
- Could also try to emphasize frequencies that are not loud enough with things like saturation so they sound crispier.
- For mastering, you will want to generally avoid changes greater than 1 dB.
- Add a 1k scoop in the EQ
- Add a stereo enhancer to fill out the stereo field.
