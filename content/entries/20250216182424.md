According to the Steam page, Barotrauma's short description is:

> Barotrauma is a 2D co-op submarine simulator – in space, with survival horror and RPG elements. Steer your submarine, complete missions, fight monsters, fix leaks, operate machinery, man the guns and craft items, and stay alert: danger in Barotrauma doesn’t announce itself!

After playing it for a while, I've noticed that it is quite a detailed game and significantly less scary and more silly than expected. I don't really think of Barotrauma as a scary game, but I've found that I find it "comfy" (not in the mainstream understanding of the cozy game genre) in the same way as _Project Zomboid_.

The setting of Barotrauma was also surprising. I was expecting it to be eldritch horrors, but in reality it's a science-fiction game, where the monsters are aliens under the surface of one of Jupiter's moons, Europa.
