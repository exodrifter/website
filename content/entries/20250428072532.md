Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250427045042](20250427045042.md)
- The mount buttons not working is bothering me, so I want to look into it.
- Apparently, the mount buttons were not working once all the drives were mounted, because the signal UI would continually grab focus for the download button. I need to remember that Godot manages focus state globally rather than for each `SubViewport` individually.
