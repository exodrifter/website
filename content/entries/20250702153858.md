Music lesson. We're listening to my track, _undeterred_.
- I feel pretty stuck, like I have writer's block. Pretty unhappy with the music I am writing and not sure how to make it better.
- I'm doing a 4-5 polyrhythm
- Match the drums to the quintuplets
	- It will feel more satisfying to listen to and write
	- Right now, with being in 4, it feels messy
	- Think about the points of emphasis
	- When counting 5, you can do either 123 12 or 12 123
	- Put big points of emphasis on the 1s
- For the bass, could still play downbeat, but the avoid the other points of emphasis
	- Could try using low bass notes with kick and high bass notes with snare
	- Could take a loot at progressive rock
- Could match the lead up with quintuplets
- If i want a polyrhythm, it would sound better if i kept a constant flow of notes for the 4 and the 5.

Progressive rock-adjacent suggestions:
- [Jesus Molina - Quintuplets](https://youtu.be/WCQGhFD9X3A)
- [Tigran Hamasyan - The Curse](https://youtu.be/kxyFWewUvA0)
- [Nova Collective - Dancing Machines](https://youtu.be/G1WEIvyaTTY)
- [The Mars Volta - De-Loused In The Comatorium](https://youtu.be/8l7Ix-LfSBA) (punk)
- [Yes - Roundabout](https://youtu.be/pk3HBb0mh5Q) (very active bassline)
