Notes from Tanuki after showing _no signal_ at Toronto Game Expo:
- People seem to become interested if we describe the game as "point and click outer wilds"
- 17 people played the game
- The reactor scene is too dark even on max screen brightness
- People have trouble backtracking to find information that they have read, and a few people said they would have liked a way to view the drives after reading and loading them once.
- People requested a map because they where getting lost even with a limited amount of rooms.
- For future games, an attract screen when the game is idle would be nice for the purposes of a convention
- Players want to see more physical notes

I don't think I'm going to add support for viewing drives after reading and loading them due to time constraints, but I think it would be nice to add a map.

TODOs:
- [ ] Remove collision from cords on server rack in communications room
- [ ] Make the reactor sliding puzzle brighter or more noticeable
- [ ] Add buttons for rotating the camera
- [ ] One of the menus might not have right click to leave the menu or the player meant that it's not described in the controls. Probably need to improve the controls UI to describe all the inputs, though I might want to wait until I add support for rebinding controls.
- [ ] Add gamma control so that players can adjust brightness
- [ ] Add transparency to the lid of the fuse box or a note to help people find the fuses in the storage room
- [ ] Add a map button
