My track sounds like Gran Tourismo 1 licensed music from a band called Garbage. It has a mixture of digital and analog sounds

The layered vocals don't sound like anything; would recommend using EQ to emphasize good frequencies and deemphasize bad frequencies. Would also suggest using EQ on all tracks in general.

1k is usually reduced. It sounds metallic and hurts your ear
2k+ brings out the pitch and texture quality. Textures will always come out in the high range.

Think about how frequencies overlap. The overlapping vocal track can:
- Cut out the low end
- Emphasize higher frequencies

Feel free to be more extreme with the EQ, then turn down the volume so that it cannot be discerned that they are different instruments. You might also have to adjust the attack so the attack is the same to get the effect of it sounding like one instrument.
