Watching a video about the negative impacts of tourism in Kyoto called _[Are Kyoto Locals Sick of "Tourists"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCkuiDmQOqo)_

One of the ways Kyoto is trying to address the large tourism numbers is by hiking lodging taxes per guest or adding tiered pricing to visit local tourist attractions. The lodging tax is supposed to be used to help expand its bus system and hire more bus drivers.

Kyoto is also trying to educate tourists with a public campaign, but this information is hard to find and the host claims that it isn't posted in enough places.
