Music lesson, talking about _the creek next to my home_, using the royal road chord progression at my music lesson:
- The melody sounds like a specific Ghibli soundtrack now, One Summer's Day by Joe Hisaishi. this is good!
- Lo-fi doesn't normally have as much activity in the drum roll, could remove some ghost notes and some of the faster bass drum notes
- Remove the melody when the drums come in, this is known as a "band entrance", and then add the melody back in.
- Drums need to be processed more, I could consider getting a lo-fi drum kit to get closer to the right sound.
- Line the kick up with 1/6 beat instead of 1/4 step.
- Play the open hat with the kick right before a beat for an offset feeling
- Keep the ghost notes, but make them softer.
- Could increase the saturation of the drums. Processing it through an amp in a gain stage could be considered saturation. Saturation is like when the signal gets louder and distorted while keeping the volume under control.
- Consider looking into fab filter for saturation.

I need to learn how to export midi scores of my songs, I only know how to do it per pattern right now.
