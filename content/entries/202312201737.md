Notes about my music assignment:
- The second line is not connected enough, try using legato or sustaining vowels in a word like thought.
- Not only does the singer need to take breaks from singing, the listener also needs to have a break from vocals.
- When harmonizing a melody, don't start on the root of a chord, as this tends to make it sound cornier.

A **pedal chord** or **pedal note** is when you play the same note/chord indefinitely.

Example chord progression: am FM7 dm7 CM7
Similar: Westworld S1 Main Theme

Homework: Add instrumentation to the lyrics.
