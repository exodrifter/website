I noticed when a player was playing the game, that the letter in the wordmark for a player spins faster than it's supposed to. I noted this issue in [20250722201506](20250722201506.md), but I was unable to determine the reason. I could not replicate it and it appeared that I was using the `delta` time correctly.

I asked that player for system specs, and they are:
- Intel i7-10700K @ 3.80GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10 GB)
- 64.0 GB RAM

This player mentioned that they've played several games where some things in the game happen faster than they're supposed to, resulting in bugs.
