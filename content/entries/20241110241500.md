For doors that go between scenes in _no signal_, I've had this pattern of creating an extra pair of animations to easily switch to the open or closed state of a door, for a total of four animations:

- `open` - The open animation
- `close` - The close animation
- `opened` - A single frame which sets the door to the opened state
- `closed` - A single frame which sets the door to the closed state

Setting up this extra animation is tedious, but it was something I did because I wasn't sure how to play the last frame of an animation. However, when I was implementing the ability to save and load the state of other doors in the game, I found out that many of them don't have an `opened` and `closed` animation and I was reluctant to make them, so I explored how to do it again.

As expected, the paths that I probably tried before didn't seem to work in Godot 4.3.stable.

The following attempt fails, because it still plays the opening sound despite the fact that `update_only` is true. I suspect this is because the sound is played on the very first frame.

```gdscript
play("open")
seek(get_animation("open").length, false, true)
```

The following also fails, as the door fails to open at all:

```gdscript
play_backwards("open")
stop()
```

I thought this was because the `play_backwards` function didn't actually do anything until the next process, but manually requesting and update didn't work either:

```gdscript
play_backwards("open")
advance(0)
stop()
```

However, I noticed that the documentation for `play_backwards` mentioned that it was the same as `play`, but with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end = true`. This is very similar to what I want, except with a `custom_speed` of `0` since I don't want the animation to play. Calling the `play` function myself appears to work:

```gdscript
play("open", -1, 0, true)
```
