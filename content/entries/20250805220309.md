Trying to figure out why the game crashes or freezes on some people's computers when playing _no signal_.

Someone provided a log which spammed the following error into the log:

```
ERROR: Condition "err != VK_SUCCESS" is true. Returning: ERR_CANT_CREATE
   at: swap_chain_resize (drivers/vulkan/rendering_device_driver_vulkan.cpp:3168)
```

Another similar log was produced by running the game with `--rendering-driver opengl3`, which spammed this error message to the console:

```
ERROR: GL ERROR: Source: OpenGL	Type: Error	ID: 1286	Severity: High	Message: GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error generated. Operation is not valid because a bound framebuffer is not framebuffer complete.
   at: _gl_debug_print (drivers/gles3/rasterizer_gles3.cpp:189)
```

This log was produced by toggling OBS's capture of the game window. This was done with OBS v29.1.3. The game didn't crash and it produced this log. This is the same as the issue originally brought up in [20250804221953](20250804221953.md).

In general, this crash doesn't seem to happen consistently; you might have to toggle capture multiple times (<10) before it happens.

For the issue, it seems like [godotengine/godot#71929](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/71929) is the issue. There's something going on here with how Godot interacts with Vulkan... it's unlikely that I'll be able to do something about it.
