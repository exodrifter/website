This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Teknedia was very different from what I usually do; it’s in 3D, written in C++, and I was part of a team of six. I joined the Teknedia development team at the start of 2012. Although the development of this game had already started before I joined, I became a co-founder of the start-up company responsible for the game, Stache Studios. I usually work on the UI and network code for the game, but as anyone else on the team I’ve also helped out in a couple of different areas. For example, some of the sound effects for the game are made by me.

Teknedia is a first person, 3D platformer game for the PC where the goal is to make it to the end of the level as quickly as possible while avoiding all of the plentiful hazards along the way. The game is built from an engine made from scratch in C++ using open source libraries such as Boost, Bullet, Lua, and OpenGL.
