I learned about the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium (LSIC) today, which is an organization that tries to help NASA keep the United States at the forefront of lunar exploration.

It appears that they have several focus areas:
- In Situ Resource Utilization
- Surface Power
- Excavation & Construction
- Crosscutting Capabilities

Each focus area holds regular meetings, and these meetings are recorded and hosted for free at https://lsic.jhuapl.edu/
