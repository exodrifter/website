Trying to make a one-liner version of [20241008204358](20241008204358.md) so that I can use it to export all krita files in a directory.

The bash one-liner, along with `optipng` (something that I almost always want to use when exporting PNGs) looks like this:

```bash
for a in *.kra; do file=$(basename $a .kra); unzip -p $file.kra mergedimage.png >$file.png; optipng $file.png; done
```
