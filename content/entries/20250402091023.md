I wanted to add a plugin to Discourse, so I followed the usual steps for doing so, which involves adding the plugin to the app configuration and then running `./launcher rebuild app`.

However, I accidentally forgot that `./launcher rebuild app` will also update Discourse -- but the update failed. So, now I'm stuck trying to figure out why the update failed. Looking at the logs, I see:

```

Running `discourse-doctor` does not successfully diagnose the problem.

First, I looked up the "`/root` is not writable" error message and found this [Discourse support thread](https://meta.discourse.org/t/rebuilding-app-weird-error/358439). However, there was no resolution to this issue in the thread and the original poster appears to have a working Discourse instance, so I doubt this is the issue.

Looking up the error message about the unsupported header online, I find a [Discourse support thread](https://meta.discourse.org/t/cant-rebuild-due-to-aws-sdk-gem-bump-and-new-aws-data-integrity-protections/354217) about the same issue dating back to Feb 24th. I use Backblaze for S3 storage and apparently, the AWS SDK developers introduced a breaking change with no regard to third party implementations and won't fix it:

> The problem is that a checksum (either the Content-MD5 header or one of the new checksum headers) is required (rather than just supported) for these operations, and this causes the current AWS SDKs to provide the new checksum header. As far as I know, there is no way to override this and have the SDK provide Content-MD5 as it used to.

It also appears that the AWS SDK will not be fixed, as the issue was raised but closed as "not planned":

The fix appears to be to remove the `expire_missing_assets` step:

However, this also fails with the same error. It appears that the `s3:upload_assets` step fails before it gets to expiring the missing assets.

Reading earlier in the thread, I see that a different suggestion was made first:

> [Falco (Discourse team)](https://meta.discourse.org/t/cant-rebuild-due-to-aws-sdk-gem-bump-and-new-aws-data-integrity-protections/354217/11)

> ```plaintext
> AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION: WHEN_REQUIRED
> AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION: WHEN_REQUIRED
> ```

Judging by the context in the thread, I'm guessing that this is *also* required as part of the workaround. So, I try again with the ENV change and also the `expire_missing_assets` step commented out:

```yml
env:
  AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION: WHEN_REQUIRED
  AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION: WHEN_REQUIRED
  ## elided

## elided

hooks:
  ## elided  
  after_assets_precompile:
    - exec:
        cd: $home
        cmd:
          - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets
##        - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:expire_missing_assets
```

It works!

This does mean that assets won't be deleted from the bucket anymore...

...but I think that's an okay workaround for now.
