Watching "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" by Casey Muratori. He brought up an excellent quote from Marc "Mahk" LeBlanc, who was the person working at Looking Glass who implemented the ECS for Thief:

> A compile-time hierarchy that matches the domain model.

I think it's a great perspective which elucidates several different things that I've been thinking about, including:

- How games tend to only represent economic systems that are capitalist, which I think is annoying.
- How software and math can be artful and playful without any consideration of how reality works.

I think it's a great point to make that there's no reason software needs to represent how the real world works exactly, and I feel the same way about art and games.
