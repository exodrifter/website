Watching a talk called "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" by Casey Muratori which was given at BSC 2025. BSC is the [Better Software Conference](https://bettersoftwareconference.com/) and it is an invite-only conference in Sweden, but was livestreamed to the public for free. This appears to be the first year that BSC has taken place; the YouTube channel was created on Nov 29, 2024 and I can't find any evidence of BSC taking place before then.

They don't say when the conference was on their website, but I did find [a tweet that was retweeted by the official BSC Twitter account](https://x.com/LubaRaphael/status/1944663366154514715) on `2025-07-14T07:40:51Z` which says:

> Day three (five?) of [@BetterSoftwareC](https://x.com/BetterSoftwareC) is starting soon! Watch it live at [https://twitch.tv/bettersoftware](https://t.co/TqtTF0NUTx)

Which is enough information to inductively determine that the conference took place on July 12th to July 15th. They also don't describe the conference on their website, but their official Twitter account has a tagline which simply says:

> Software is getting worse. We're here to make it better.
