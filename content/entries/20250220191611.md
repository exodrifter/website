After updating my Arch system, I try to run OpenSeeFace with my usual script `osf.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

source venv/bin/activate

sleep 1

python3.9 OpenSeeFace/facetracker.py \
  -c $2 \
  --fps 30 \
  --faces 1 \
  --silent 1 \
  --model 3
```

However, it seems that OpenSeeFace is no longer working:

```

```

Looking up this issue, I found [microsoft/onnxruntime#16116](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/16116). In particular, [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/16116#issuecomment-1665530454) suggested that I might need to install a specific version. Inspecting my installation script `install-osf.sh` for OpenSeeFace, I see:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

source venv/bin/activate

python3.9 -m ensurepip
python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3.9 install onnxruntime opencv-python pillow numpy

deactivate
```

When I run this script, `pip` reports that all of the requirements are already satisfied and doesn't make any changes. In fact, if I run`pip list --outdated` it appears that my packages are _very_ out of date:

```
Package       Version  Latest    Type
------------- -------- --------- -----
flatbuffers   2.0      25.2.10   wheel
numpy         1.23.1   2.0.2     wheel
onnxruntime   1.11.1   1.19.2    wheel
opencv-python 4.6.0.66 4.11.0.86 wheel
Pillow        9.2.0    11.1.0    wheel
protobuf      4.21.2   5.29.3    wheel
setuptools    58.1.0   75.8.0    wheel
```

So, I figured I could try updating to the latest version first instead of to a specific version (note the `--upgrade` flag):

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

source venv/bin/activate

python3.9 -m ensurepip
python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3.9 install --upgrade onnxruntime opencv-python pillow numpy

deactivate
```

This upgraded all of the packages, but now OpenSeeFace reports a different error:

```
AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'float'.
`np.float` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `float`. To avoid this error in existi
ng code, use `float` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If
you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.float64` here.
The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see t
he original release note at:
    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations

ne 394, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError(__former_attrs__[attr])
```

In fact, it reports this error a _lot_. I figure this is because OpenSeeFace needs to be updated as well, so I run `git pull` to update OpenSeeFace from `91a556f` to `e6e24ef`.

Trying to run OpenSeeFace with `osf.sh` after the pull works!
