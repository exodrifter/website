Working on _no signal_ offline today.

I'm trying to figure out how to export just the demo files, which I have tried to do before. You would normally think that selecting the `Export selected scenes (and dependencies)` option would work, but it does not because Godot apparently doesn't have a complete dependency graph.

To fix this, I had to select the `Export selected resources (and dependencies)` option instead and make the following adjustments:
- Add localization files referenced by the `Localization > Translations` setting.
- Add `.gdshaderinc` files that another shader would `#include`.
- Add resources that another script would `preload` or `load`, even if that variable has an `@export` annotation or is `const`.
- Add static classes that are referenced by other scripts (or convert them into autoloaded singletons).
- Add custom class_names referenced by other scripts For example, if a script has a variable with the type `Foobar` or a static function is called on the class `Foobar`, then the corresponding script `foobar.gd` would need to be included. Related: [godotengine/godot#51717](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/51717)
- Add images embedded in `RichTextLabel` bbcode.

In general, it appears that I will have to do a major refactor to get rid of the use of `const preload`, which I use very often throughout the codebase.
