Trying to figure out why I have so many orphaned objects in my game. As it turns out, whenever you use `duplicate`, `instantiate`, or remove a node from the scene tree, Godot maintains a reference to that node even when the script which is holding a reference to the node is deleted.

You can use `print_orphan_nodes()` to find out what is being leaked (see: https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/f9gsry/comment/firj4w2/).

I also found that there is a orphan count monitor in the Godot debugger.

In _no signal_, this caused a rather big memory leak as none of the old scenes were ever freed:

```gdscript
tree.root.remove_child(tree.current_scene) # Doesn't delete the old scene!
```

I needed to do this instead:

```gdscript
tree.current_scene.free()
```

I also have a frequent pattern where I hold onto a reference or a duplicate of a node instance to use as an easy way to instantiate another instance of that scene tree, but this leaks unless I explicitly free these nodes later.

This is because `Node` is not `RefCounted`, so Godot expects you to manage them explicitly.
