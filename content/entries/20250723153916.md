Music lesson, listening to sapphire water
- I explained...
- What if the snare was more focused and less airy? It sounds like it is being hit by a brush. A more solid hit might make the track feel more focused.
- If I wanted to make the music more dynamic, I could use the buildup as the intro, into the groove, and then use the intro as the bridge.
- You need to consider the balance between making it interesting for the listener and making things in the music feel earned.
- I was thinking about writing lyrics for this track, so I asked my teacher if they knew any examples of singing on a 5 beat timing.
