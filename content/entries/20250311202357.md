_no signal_ stream 182:
- Copied TODOs from [20250311005729](20250311005729.md)
- Realized this morning that the reason joystick input is cumbersome is because I always normalize the joystick input.
- I found out that Godot's [`Input.get_vector`] merely clamps the input range for axis input when the vector has a length greater than one. So, I looked into remapping square inputs into circular ones for joystick inputs. I found [a proof](https://mathproofs.blogspot.com/2005/07/mapping-square-to-circle.html) which allows such a mapping with minimal distortion. I found out that it is called "elliptical grid mapping"  from this paper titled _[Analytical Methods for Squaring the Disc](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06344v1)_. However, it appears that such a mapping is not a great way to deal with things, because [input devices do not always use circular input mappings](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4urddr/how_to_deal_with_joysticks_that_map_out_squares/). Considering the situation, I think `Input.get_vector` is good enough.
- `warp_mouse` doesn't work on Wayland at all (see [godotengine/godot#103777](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/103777))

Tanuki:
- [x] Articulate piano keys
- [ ] Decorate music room
- [x] Fix Rubix cube UVs
- [ ] Make Naoko's charm model
- [ ] Switch velcro mats to something more "traditional"?
- [ ] Bobby-fy `meeting-a plan`
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in medical room
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in workshop

TODO:
- [x] Update joystick motion to not always be normalized
- [ ] Add joystick motion support for puzzle
- [ ] Add support for map, notes, reset camera, and hint system with controller
- [ ] No noise for small fuse box?
- [ ] Update input tutorial to show controller or mouse inputs
- [ ] Update puzzle hint to show controller inputs
- [ ] ~~Add a way to invoke the hint button on con~~ Duplicate
- [ ] Hover state should go away when mouse is hidden or captured
- [ ] Don't recreate `Control`s in chat log when drive is decrypted
- [ ] Add a button for next/previous drive when mounting drives
- [x] Sensitivity range goes too high and not enough detail for lower values
- [x] Sensitivity setting is unreadable at small values
- [ ] ~~Add gyro control support~~ This is not as needed anymore thanks to the fact that controller input isn't always normalized now, and can also be addressed by adding gyro support in the default input mapping on Steam deck.
- [x] Wire in comms is null
- [ ] ~~Popup can get stuck open after using right click to remove broken drive?~~ Can't reproduce
- [x] Panning doesn't close popup
- [ ] Up/down in chat log needs to work with both analog and dpad
- [ ] Make the entire drive bay clickable so it is easier to click on for controller and touch inputs
- [x] Right click and escape don't work on title screen
- [x] Don't use mouse warp by default, because of Wayland
- [x] Don't start in screen mode
- [x] Let zoom out work for exiting screen
- [ ] ~~maybe use dpad for moving circuits in puzzle?~~ I'd have to implement another input mode for this and it could be confusing for users who don't realize there's two different input modes for the puzzle
- [ ] Change "editing card" to "card corrected" in card writer
- [ ] Add card writer program name when editing cards
- [x] Add visual reboot notice when reactor is restarting
- [ ] Add a note in center from Bobby about rewiring the storage instead of note on back of comms card
- [ ] Arrow keys don't appear in orbit input mapping?

Part Two:
- [ ] Make toilets flushable
- [ ] Implement Rubix cube
- [ ] Add poem song puzzle to music room
- [ ] Make doors in bathroom open
- [ ] Add starfish model to 2g (see `radio-a nevaeh`)
- [ ] Music room is missing drive bay and dialog screen
- [ ] Add compliance decal to office
- [ ] Add decal that describes the Oberth effect
- [ ] Add decoy drive bays to gravity backup
- [ ] Add sliding puzzles to gravity backup
- [ ] Add cork board with clues in meeting room

Part Three:
- [ ] Add breathing sounds
- [ ] Dynamically change resolution of cinematic
- [ ] Add cables in EVA
