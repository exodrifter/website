I'm working on moving t/suki's discourse instance from Orlando, FL to San Francisco, CA again. Yesterday, my first attempt failed because the snapshot got stuck in the transferring state even though it was done transferring according to support.

Support hasn't been terribly helpful, making several mistakes and has generally just implied that I should try it again, including in their last message. I'm guessing that their self-service actions just take a long time (their documentation suggests that it should take a few minutes, but it appears it actually takes a few hours instead), so I think I need to be more patient.

Before responding to support again, I figure I'll give it another attempt:

1. **2025-04-06 22:32** Shut down the sever and started a snapshot.
2. **2025-04-07 01:18** The snapshot finished, and I started the transfer of the image to San Francisco, CA. I see a progress indicator for the transfer, and at first it proceeds smoothly before getting stuck at 17% after about a minute or two.
3. **2025-04-07 02:10** I've been periodically refreshing the page, and it appears to finally be available now. Provisioning a new server with that snapshot works!

It worked! I sent an email to support telling them that I no longer need assistance.
