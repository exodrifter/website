I asked my dentist for some advice on how to prevent gingivitis, and she recommended the following:

- Brush twice a day
- Floss once a day
- Get a dental cleaning every 6 months

I had been previously recommended by another dentist to use a product called Waterpik as a way to prevent gingivitis, and I asked if she concurred with this recommendation. She explained that it's better than not flossing, but flossing is still better. However, if I fail to build a flossing habit (it is unfortunately a difficult habit for most people to form), then it would be better than nothing.

I also asked if it mattered whether or not I brush before or after eating food, for example before or after breakfast. Strictly speaking, she said brushing after eating is better but it didn't matter too much because the entire point of brushing is to disturb the biofilm that builds up on your teeth. The biofilm is where the bacteria which gives you gingivitis and cavities builds up. Disturbing it by brushing every 12 hours is recommended, even if you don't have toothpaste available. Even "brushing" your teeth with a cloth would be better than nothing, as it would still mechanically disrupt the biofilm.
