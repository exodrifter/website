Try staying out of the original key, so use an anticipatory key/harmony.

In A minor, the F note can be added to make it feel suspended, so we can use an F chord. So, we can use a VI or VII chord to build anticipation since they feel like they need to resolve to something.

Example chords:
- F F G A C (added ninth)
- G G G B C (added fourth)

Also consider using long sustained notes for the first two lines, then playing the notes more frequently the second time.
