I ran into a weird import issue in Godot 4.2.2 while working on Ultraprocessor Ribbon:

```
editor/import/resource_importer_scene.cpp:2405 - Condition "!save_path.is_empty() && !DirAccess::exists(save_path.get_base_dir())" is true. Returning: ERR_FILE_BAD_PATH
  Error importing 'res://scenes/background/3d_backgrounds/locomotive/locomotive.blend'.
```

This issue was preventing me from running the game. I tried restarting Godot and deleting my `.godot` folder, but these did not resolve the issue.

The relevant source code can be seen [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.2.2-stable/editor/import/resource_importer_scene.cpp#L2397-L2410):

```cpp
Error ResourceImporterScene::_check_resource_save_paths(const Dictionary &p_data) {
	Array keys = p_data.keys();
	for (int i = 0; i < keys.size(); i++) {
		const Dictionary &settings = p_data[keys[i]];

		if (bool(settings.get("save_to_file/enabled", false)) && settings.has("save_to_file/path")) {
			const String &save_path = settings["save_to_file/path"];

			ERR_FAIL_COND_V(!save_path.is_empty() && !DirAccess::exists(save_path.get_base_dir()), ERR_FILE_BAD_PATH);
		}
	}

	return OK;
}
```

It seems like that Godot is loading a path from an import configuration and is trying to check if a path defined in that config exists. Sure enough, when checking the advanced import settings for the `locomotive.blend` file, I found several animations, materials, and meshes in the tree which defined a `save_to_file/path` value which pointed to a folder that did not exist.

We didn't need to import any of these animations, so setting the `save_to_file/enabled` property to `false` _should_ be enough to fix the issue. However, it looks like Godot keeps setting the value back to `true` after I close the advanced import settings dialog. In fact, it seems like I can't change _any_ of the values at all. So, I resorted to editing the `.import` file directly, setting `_subresources={}`, and then re-opening Godot. This resolved the issue.
