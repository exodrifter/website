A playtester for _no signal_ tried running the game on MacOS, but found that they couldn't. Instead, MacOS displayed this error (edited to remove the timestamp):

> **"no signal" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.**
> Firefox downloaded this file today at XX:XX.

I'm aware that Apple likes to do this kind of thing for unsigned applications downloaded from the internet, which is the case for _no signal_. The usual workaround is to right click on the application and click open, but this doesn't work for them.

Eventually, they found out the following workaround based on [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/13vu7f3/comment/jm9t3yw/).

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "no signal.app"
```
