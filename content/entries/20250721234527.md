Thinking about the "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" talk by Casey Muratori. There was something that I disagreed with while watching this on stream that I feel is worth noting. At one point in the talk he says...

> And we could have had \[discriminated unions\] from day one if someone had just believed that this was good.

...after talking about C.A.R Hoare's paper 1966 *Record Handling*. However, the language ML was first introduced in 1973 and it has pattern matching. ML went on to influence successful functional programming languages like Haskell.

I suppose Casey means that he wishes it was picked up by the mainstream, but I think the framing of it seeming like the idea was lost at that point is a little unfair.

Perhaps it's possible that ML didn't have pattern matching until relatively recently; I'm not actually sure if ML was introduced with pattern matching or if not, when it was added exactly.
