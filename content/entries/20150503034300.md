This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Parallel Dimension Hopper is a game about an urban explorer who stumbles upon a device that shows an alternate, more extreme version of reality. The game was inspired by a creepy pasta story, [The Other Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QESMgHxo6Ww).

This game was made at the Electronic Game Developers Society 2015 Chili Jam in under 24 hours. I was the coder and writer for the game and my partner, Luben Popov, was the 3D modeler.

Here are some hints about the game that are not immediately obvious:
-  You need 4 keys to exit the apartment building and win the game
-  Keys do not disappear when you pick them up.
