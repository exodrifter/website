Tried out a seitan recipe recently, but never wrote notes on it.

Dry:
- 2 1/4 cups vital wheat gluten flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast

Wet:
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons liquid smoke

I failed to mix the dough very evenly since I added the wet ingredients all at once instead of gradually mixing it in. I boiled the seitan in a vegetable broth using _Better than Bullion_.

The seitan seemed to come out okay, though the flavor ended up being a little lacking. I think I could use more seasoning next time.

Apparently seitan is a traditional Asian ingredient, which I was not aware of.
