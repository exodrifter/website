I asked my mom how to make Kroeung. She said that I could find it at the store sold as "Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste". But, if I wanted to make it myself I would need to blend the following ingredients:

* Chopped lemongrass, 2-3 stems
* Kaffir Lime leaf, 1 tbsp chopped
* Salt 1 tbsp
* Tumeric 1 tbsp
* Galanga 1 tbsp
* Garlic 6 cloves
* 2 big Shallots
* Fish Sauce 1 tbsp or shrimp paste
* Red Pepper or Paprika
