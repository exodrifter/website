A **cadence** is the process of moving from one chord to another cord. They usually happens at the end of a **phrase** or **chord progression**.

A **full cadence** gives you the "fullest possible resolution". Usually `V -> I` or `V -> i` We usually add notes like `V7` or `G7` so we can have more leading tones.

**Leading tones** are one half step away from the next chord. So `G7 -> I` has the leading tones `B` and `F`, since they are one half step away from `C` and `E`.

A good resolution will have at least one leading tone and at least one common tone (a shared note).

In classical music, they called this a **perfect authentic cadences**, because the root note would move a fifth interval down (`G` to `C`)

If I inverted the notes of one chord, you might want to also invert the other. This is because **voice leading** can change how connected chords sound to each other.
