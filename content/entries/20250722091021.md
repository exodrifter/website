I'm writing a note about Wonka, and I'm deciding what genre of film it would be. According to Wikipedia, it describes the film as a musical fantasy film. These feel like an accurate description to me based on what I remember about the film.

I also remember that the film appears to be a prequel, as it shows a younger Wonka, before the events of the original film *Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory*.

The director of the film was Paul King, [according to NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/14/1219246957/director-paul-king-discusses-his-new-movie-wonka-a-willy-wonka-origin-story).
