Listening to my cover of _Something Comforting_ by Porter Robin.

Suggestions:
- Add a sub bass
- Copy a synth and put it up an octave for more texture
- Make the bassdrum punchier with compression.

Some of the chords are still in the wrong key. One of them is a C Major, but it should be a C Minor chord with an added 7th. The added 7th makes it sound less minor, which is why it's a bit hard to tell.

Usually, you will want to put compression for the kick _first_ in the effect chain. Also add a limiter.

Compressors on snares tend to make them sound washed out. For EQ:
- 2-5k for snapping sound of snare drum
- 200-500 for resonant chamber of snare drum

We will talk about resolutions and leading tones next week.
