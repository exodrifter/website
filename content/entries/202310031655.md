Listening to Ignition by WURK:

- Lyrics tend to be simple and play the same note in a row, you can get away with this because the words are different.
- One trick is to play a longer phrase of repeating notes and then doing it again shorter with less repeating notes.
- Instead of developing the song by using a second vocal verse, use an instrumental solo
- Backing vocals at the end mimic the notes the sax/trumpet was playing earlier

Write simpler melodies for vocals, so they are easier to sing and they the meaning of the song comes through. If you have a more complicated melody, it can detract make it harder for the meaning of the words to come across.
