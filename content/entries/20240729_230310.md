_no signal_ stream 105:
- `prodzpod` just finished playing the game on their stream
- Took note of things i forgot to do or things that `prodzpod` ran into:
	- [x] Detect puzzle movement on mouse button down instead of up
	- [x] Figure out why puzzle is sometimes unfocused when clicking on it
	- [ ] ~~Make the computer labels more obvious, move them into view so the players know they exist~~ There's not a very good place to put the label, and the game is still playable without knowing the labels exist; the computer labels just make the game easier. I think we could point out this mechanic using a dialog later, if necessary.
	- [x] For some reason, the card code not being loaded (it is being written to, though)
	- [ ] Implement nicer click UI for card code
	- [x] Change elevator sequences from A B to B C so players don't assume that the A sequence is reused from the communication card
	- [ ] Add an animation which verifies that the card is in a valid state
	- [x] Disable center/ring button in the elevator based on where you are
	- [ ] Limit the camera to the bounds of the level
	- [ ] Add a button to reset the camera
	- [ ] Add sounds for when chats are downloaded
	- [ ] Add sound for when radar detects no items left
	- [x] Show text indicating that no items are left on hint button
	- [ ] ~~Show text indicating that an unknown number of items are left when hint isn't used yet~~ (Decided I don't like the look of this)
	- [x] Hide anchor when right clicking or using WASD to move
	- [ ] ~~When the download throbber fades out, it inverts the colors for some reason~~ Couldn't determine the source of this issue. It's rendered fine in Godot when it's just the UI, but when it's being rendered to a viewport it doesn't render correctly. However, it's a pretty minor visual issue that has no impact on gameplay and it's probably not worth my time to continue investigating at the moment.
