Asking questions to [ClericSupport](https://www.twitch.tv/clericsupport) about various things:
- **What's an OTT compressor?** It stands for Over The Top compresson. It's a popular compressor used to help sounds stand out by essentially eliminating the dynamic range of your sounds.
- **What's a glue compressor?** It's a compressor that you normally use on buses to help the audio sound more cohesive.
- **Why do you want to use a BPM to millisecond release calculator?** In dance tracks, you want the pumping effect of sidechaining to be synced to the BPM. By picking a millisecond release with a specific interval which matches the BPM, this causes the sidechained volume to pump back up at the right time, keeping everything rhythmic.
