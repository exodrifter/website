[Outfrost](https://www.twitch.tv/outfrost) told me to look at the fix for the Nahimic software issue. The Godot PR that fixes it is [godotengine/godot#99388](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99388).

It references [the code for KiCad](https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen/windows_2app_8cpp_source.html#:~:text=So%20there%20exists%20this%20malware%20called%20Nahimic%20by%20A-Volute), where it states (paraphrasing):

> Nahimic by A-Volute is audio software which causes OpenGL to misbehave. The developers of this software apparently noticed that this is an issue, so it has its own disallow list of common applications that it checks before injecting itself. For some reason, it's also designed to inject itself into _every_ application. Obviously, there are a lot more applications than that, but thankfully the software also checks for the symbol `NoHotPatch`, so this is another way around the issue.
>
> Unfortunately, vendors like MSi and Alienware package the Nahimic service along with their drivers, so it tends to get reinstalled on user's systems even after being disabled.
