I noticed [OnizumiKohari](https://www.twitch.tv/onizumikohari) while browsing the Software & Game Development category, since they are both a VTuber and they were using Godot. They're working on a game called "Is this a Game yet?" ([itch.io](https://littleneedleinteractive.itch.io/is-this-a-game-yet) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3831220/Is_this_a_Game_yet/)) which has a design led entirely by player suggestions.

However, as stated in their stream and Steam description, the game uses generative AI whenever possible.

Twitch Description:
> I do all kinds of stuff and utilize generative AI to streamline development of my games, create music, update my fully self-made Live2D model and more.

Steam Description:
> Generative AI is being used for asset creation during development wherever possible (e.g. sprites, backgrounds, music) to ensure that I, as a solo developer, can keep up with the rapidly evolving nature of this project and meet both my own standards and player expectations of a polished experience.
