Watching a video about the negative impacts of tourism in Kyoto called _[Are Kyoto Locals Sick of "Tourists"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCkuiDmQOqo)_

The host of Tokyo Lens, Norm Nakamura, pointed out that Japan has a lot of cultural norms and rules that don't exist in other countries such as:

- No smoking on public streets
- Stand to the side when standing on an escalator
- No eating while walking
- Don't touch Sakura trees
- Wear your backpack on the front when riding a crowded bus
- No sitting on the steps to the temple or eating food there

He also said that it could be hard to remember all of the rules, even if you were a Japanese local. He suggested that if you're visiting you should defer to behaving in the same way that everyone else around you is doing.

Some particularly bad behavior include:
- The harassing of others in public transit
- Littering
- Public urination
