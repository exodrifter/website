Learning about the rotary effect:
- Rotaries modify the sound in the following ways: Gain, pitch, and panning. All of these parameters are fluctuating between a lower and upper value.
- The panning is usually never hard left or hard right.
- The gain is usually also fluctuating and it doesn't have the same wavelength as the pitch. This gives a sort of wobbly sound.
