Showing _no signal_ at the monthly MADE showcase.
- The previous log's uncompleted tasks in [20250625184409](20250625184409.md) have been completed. I'm still sending emails, but I don't think that needs to be tracked anymore now that the email template has been made.
- They lent me a monitor and HDMI cable to use, which was nice.
	- I should remember to bring a display port adapter, just in case.
- Someone called the game "space myst"
- It was suggested to me that my game is similar to Tacoma and event\[0\]
- The showcase was much quieter than past MADE showcases that I've attended, probably on account of the showcase having been rescheduled to July 5th in order to avoid the July 4th holiday the week prior.

TODO:
- [ ] Change beginning prompt to say "press any button" instead of "click to continue"
- [ ] You can keep the drive bay UI open somehow

I also tried to help a developer with some controller issues they were running into. We couldn't figure out why a controller input wasn't working. We ended up discovering that the input was configured to only use input from device 0, and the device we were trying to use had been assigned a different index.
