Watching a video about the negative impacts of tourism in Kyoto called _[Are Kyoto Locals Sick of "Tourists"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCkuiDmQOqo)_

In general, while residents who were interviewed are understandably annoyed and upset, they also have a pretty balanced view. For example, they understand that manners are up to the person rather than their country of origin, that warning signs are easy to miss, and that the city doesn't do enough like placing more trash cans to prevent litter.

There are also a lot of tourists visiting Kyoto and you're bound to end up with some tourists who are much worse than others.

One suggestion a resident made was to give all passengers on inbound flights an informational packet on manners and customs before arriving to the country.
