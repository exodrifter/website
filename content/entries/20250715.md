Transcribing an undated pickles recipe that my father wrote yesterday after calling my mom for the recipe. For the first step, he meant 1 Tbsp of salt. The quantity of pickles is unknown, but it's roughly the size of three 24oz pasta jars. I'm not sure if this is a kind of Cambodian pickling recipe or if it's just a family recipe.
