After converting all of my lightweight tags to annotated ones, I noticed that the dates were all out of order. I decided that I wanted the tags to have the same dates as the respective commits, so I wrote a script to do that based on [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21032471):
 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for tag in `git tag`; do
    date="$(git show $tag^0 -s --format=%aD)"
    GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="$date" git tag -a -f $tag $tag^0
done
```

The original answer didn't work, because `git show $tag --format=%aD` still shows the annotated tag information before showing the commit information. I noticed that a comment on another answer suggested that adding `^0` to the tag reference would reference the commit instead of the tag, so I tried that to remove the annotated information and it worked!

However, git still opened my editor for each tag to edit the contents of the annotated tag, so I had to quit the editor for each tag. There doesn't seem to be a `--no-edit` tag in the help, like there is for `commit --amend`, so I'm not sure if there's a way around this.

After the tags had been updated, `git push --tags --force` pushed the updated tags to the remote.
