Encountered a weird camera bounds bug when trying to move around in a scene. For some reason, the character cannot move lower in the map than some amount below where the camera's initial position is. I think it's a problem with the camera limits being set incorrectly?

I'm not going to deal with this issue right now, but it's probably worth looking into since it's probably another Camera API misunderstanding.
