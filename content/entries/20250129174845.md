Music lesson:
- Talked a bit about my music album _future formant_
	- I think the worst track is _idea_, since it doesn't do a great job of combining vocals and neurofunk
	- I am most happiest with _the creek next to my home_, as it feels the closest I've ever gotten to the chill hip hop/downtempo stuff I listened to back when I first got into music. It also has a strong emotional part
	- However, most of my music lacks the emotional dynamism that I would like.
- In particular, I want to analyze [メルティランドナイトメア / はるまきごはん feat.初音ミク - Melty Land Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEy36W1xX8c) because it has a lot of emotional dynamism while being similar to my music in that it doesn't actually change that much.
	- Royal road chord progression (4, 5, inverted 1, 6)
	- There's no resolution in the chord progression; there's a constant rising feeling
	- Using the 4 chord as its home so often
	- Really tight intro, measure repeated only twice before vocals come in
	- 9 measures in the intro; the extra measure builds anticipation
- _Melty Land Nightmare_ has a aimilar chord progression the entire time, so to make emotional moments you need to set up contrasts. For example:
	- 3:10 adds a new instrument and changes the drums
	- Could half the speed of the chord progression, then double the speed
	- Layer more instruments or change instruments

Homework:
- Make a song that is only two or four chords the entire time
