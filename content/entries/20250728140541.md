Working on _no signal_ offline
- Copied TODOs from [20250727222531](20250727222531.md)
- Tanuki and I agreed to make the piano puzzle easier

TODOs:
- [x] Simplify the audio on the _poem_ tape
- [x] Add another sheet music clue to the music room

Probably won't fix:
- [ ] Old wordmark still shows up in the credits of the game
- [ ] [#62](https://git.tsuki.games/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/62) Game freeze when accessing the EVA computer
- [ ] Another player ran into the deltatime not being accounted for correctly for the envelope in the wordmark [20250725022444](20250725022444.md)
- [ ] A player reported a lighting issue in the center, where it loads in completely dark while playing a game. Reloading the game fixes the issue.
