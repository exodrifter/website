I ran into an issue with the website CI build failing earlier today. I opened [haskell-actions/setup#122](https://github.com/haskell-actions/setup/issues/122) because I wasn't able to figure out what the issue was:

I had some more time to look into it tonight and found out that TUF is the acronym for an update framework called [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/). I assumed that this was being used by Cabal, which reminded me that I should probably look for issues in the Cabal issue tracker that might reveal what's going on. After searching for `root.json` in the Cabal issue tracker, I found [haskell/cabal#11095](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/11095).

It looks like the key signatures were updated recently, as this was merged three days ago at 2025-07-25T17:20-0700. It *might* be the cause of the build failure for me, since my last successful build was two days ago on 2025-07-26T18:57:59-07:00. In addition, there was a [comment](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/11095#issuecomment-3130811889) posted about one hour ago pointing out that this would make Cabal versions 3.10 or earlier stop working, except for 3.10.3:

Sure enough, my GitHub actions config is still using Cabal v3.10.1. I have no need to be on such an old version, so I can update the config to the newest versions that are recommended by `ghcup`:

```yaml
      - name: Set up Haskell
        uses: haskell-actions/setup@v2
        id: setup
        with:
          ghc-version: '9.6.7'
          cabal-version: '3.12.1.0'
          cabal-update: true
```
