There's a list of tips in the High Frontier 4 All appendix titled "Dom's Strategy Notes", and I was puzzling over why one of the tips was "Luna belongs to China". This was confusing to me at first, because you can't claim jump if there are humans present and you can't murder or suicide humans that you don't control.

However, upon closer inspection of the rulebook, G4b and I61 states that Claim Jumping allows you to prospect and claim Luna without the permission of the first player, so I think that's why Luna belongs to China; China can always go to Luna whenever they want (unless someone else gets to it first and keeps a human there).

If other players do not keep a human on the site after prospecting, then China can _always_ claim jump Luna before the site can be industrialized on their turn by:

- Suiciding the crew (and a spacecraft part, if China does not have 3 aqua)
- Free marketing the spacecraft part
- Loading enough fuel on the crew thruster to go to Luna
- Travel to Luna
- Claim Jump
