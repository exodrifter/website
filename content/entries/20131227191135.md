This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Orchid is a relatively minimal real time strategy game about taking over the world with your mighty military force. It was made at Ludum Dare 28 by me, William Vickery, and Jim Nguyen.

I spent most of the time putting together the enemy AI and the overall game logic such as the control points on the map and resource income. William spent most of his time working on unit behaviour and combat mechanics. Jim made all of the images and music for the game.

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished on December 16, 2013. You can find the Ludum Dare submission page [url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=15471]here[/url].
