I realized that I should probably set up a firewall on t/suki's machines.

Using `nmap forum.tsuki.games` from a remote machine, I can see:

```
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-22 13:13 PDT
Nmap scan report for forum.tsuki.games (104.245.36.36)
Host is up (0.012s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp   open     ssh
80/tcp   open     http
443/tcp  open     https
646/tcp  filtered ldp
3000/tcp open     ppp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.98 seconds
```

Looks like I have some ports open that I don't want to have open. SSH'ing into the container, I know that I need to set up a firewall with `ufw`, but I've never used it before. Running `ufw status` shows:

```
Status: inactive
```

Well, okay. I guess the first step is to enable it, right? So, I run `ufw enable`:

```
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? n
Aborted
```

Whoops. Looks like I probably need to configure the firewall first, since I don't want my SSH connection to be terminated. But how do I see what rules are currently added? The status just says that the firewall is inactive. After a brief internet search, I find out in [a StackOverflow thread](https://askubuntu.com/questions/30781/see-configured-rules-even-when-inactive) that the command to run is `sudo ufw show added`: [^1]

```
Added user rules (see 'ufw status' for running firewall):
(None)
```

That makes sense, because I've never used `ufw` on this machine before. I add the ports I want to have open, and then enable the firewall:

```sh
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow http # So nginx can redirect http requests to https
ufw allow https
ufw enable
```

Running `nmap` again, I see:

```
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-22 13:21 PDT
Nmap scan report for forum.tsuki.games (104.245.36.36)
Host is up (0.014s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
443/tcp open  https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.15 seconds
```

Now only the ports I want to have open are exposed! I went ahead and did the same for `git.tsuki.games`.
