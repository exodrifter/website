Obsidian Flavored Markdown adds a syntax option for adding Obsidian Callouts, which are nicely-formatted blocks that can be added to notes.

To make a callout, use the following code:
```
> [!note]
> Hello World!
```

This renders:
> [!note]
> Hello World!

`note` can be replaced with some other callout type. Obsidian provides the following out of the box: `abstract`, `summary`, `tldr`, `info`, `todo`, `tip`, `hint`, `important`, `success`, `check`, `done`, `question`, `help`, `faq`, `warning`, `caution`, `attention`, `failure`, `fail`, `missing`, `danger`, `error`, `bug`, `example`, `quote`, and `cite`.
