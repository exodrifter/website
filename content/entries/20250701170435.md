This is the sketch I did during my stream while thinking about possible designs for my next VTuber model (which would be my third model), which I would like to commission from Pies.

Before the stream started, I had gotten inspired by techwear fashion and asked some friends for recommendations.

I had forgotten to add the sketch to my notes, so here they are:

![An anime-style sketch. A small color swatch is in the top right, and exodrifter is facing forward. Elements of her attire are labeled; notably, she is wearing a techwear-style bolero jacket and chaps, with a crop top sweater vest and gym shorts underneath. She is also wearing hiking boots, a choker, and glasses. The clothes are gray or have the hex color #786f7e and are accented with gold.](20250701170435.png)
