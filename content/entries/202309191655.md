251 chords use what's called Chord Scale Theory, which seems to be about changing the chords frequently and focusing on the resolution between each of the chords and finding new chords that we have "access" to (other chords that have shared notes).

Homework: Write a melody over the existing chord progression. I'm encouraged to try to play notes in chords I have access to instead of just the ones in the chord.
