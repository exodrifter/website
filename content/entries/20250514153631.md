Music lesson:
- Talking about mathcore and mathrock
- mathcore is a jazz subgenre. it probably has improvisation in it.
- Talking about [*shibuya* by Covet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGwVJCdV6A)
- There's a lot of repeated patterns.
- It's has the foundation of 4/4 but with a beat added or removed at times.
- They're cutting the tail end of the pattern at different times.
- There are pretty simple harmonies.
- The chord progression is similar to royal road
- The riff is the melody, but the melody isn't doing the kind of things a melody would normally do; there aren't really many long notes.
- [*falkor* by Covet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTxSXUzc96A)
- Mathcore develops itself by adding more layers or by changing the number of beats
- The rhythm in *falkor* is a combination of 4/4 measures with beats added or removed so that the downbeat is in different places.
- Mathcore likes to use unusual numbers of notes in a measure, like quintuplets (5 notes in a measure)
- with more than 4 notes in a measure, you typically count them by 2s and 3s. For example, with 5 notes, you might count them as 2-3 or 3-2. You can think of this when structuring the melody as well.
- mathrock sounds better when there is something that is consistent, like the drums.
- try to use a tempo that is still discernable (don't go too fast)

Homework:
- Make a riff pattern
