While I was playing High Frontier 4 All, I remembered that there is one technique that my friend and I have started using that I haven't taken note of yet here. For navigating through radiation spaces, you don't necessarily have to pay fuel costs of the thruster that is used. This is because you only do the belt roll when _entering_ a radiation belt, so you can stop in the radiation belt and use a different thruster when exiting on the next turn.

Of course, this spends more time since you need to stop twice to switch to and from the high thrust thruster, but it lets you skip the fuel cost. This means that you can use crew thrusters for free, to avoid having to do the belt roll.
