Listening to *Something Comforting* by *Porter Robinson*.

In this song and in EDM in general, the chord progression doesn't change much and tension/pacing is controlled by layering.

A flat, E flat 1st inversion

It's the I to V chord, but it doesn't sound like a cadence because of the inversion. V chords also tend to sound like passing chords on the way to another chord.

The second, third, and fourth chords make a 251 chord progression, which travels around the circles of fifth. It's also known as a strong root motion.

Like at the end of the chord progression, it's good to follow leaps by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.

The top notes in the chord progression always stays the same, while the lower notes change.
