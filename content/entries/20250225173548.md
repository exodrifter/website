_no signal_ stream 175:
- Copied TODOs from [20250223181730](20250223181730.md)
- Spent some time trying to add support for removing pieces from circuits and moving those pieces between circuits, but while working on an implementation for it I realized that this mechanic would increase the amount of work I would have to do by quite a lot. This is because the puzzle data is currently encoded in the level, and I don't have a great way of encoding the state of which puzzle pieces have been removed or added to different circuits. I would essentially need to encode a diff into the save state and then apply it, or change how puzzles are encoded entirely. I don't like any of these options, and I think it would be better for me to find different ways to make the circuit puzzles more interesting at the end without increasing the development work so much.
- An alternate solution to making the puzzle more interesting at the end is by adding a power mechanic, where a specific amount of power needs to be supplied
	- For example, the rocket might require 700 units of energy and there are four energy sources which provide 150 energy, 200 energy, 250 energy, 300 energy, and 350 energy. There are two solutions to this problem: connect the 150, 200, and 350 energy sources or the 150, 250, and 300 energy sources. There can be four circuits, each connected to two of the energy sources: Circuit A which is connected to 150 and 200, B which is connected to 250 and 350, C which is connected to 150 and 250, and D which is connected to 150 and 300. The solutions then would be to either connect only circuits A and B or only C and D.
