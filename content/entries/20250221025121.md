I realized I never wrote any notes about OpenSeeFace or VSeeFace in my notes, so I wanted to add some basic information about them.

[VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu), or VSF, is a VTubing application that I've been using for a while to stream on Twitch. It describes itself as:

> VSeeFace is a free, highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM and [VSFAvatar](https://www.vseeface.icu/#vsfavatar) avatar puppeteering program for virtual youtubers with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality. VSeeFace offers functionality similar to Luppet, 3tene, Wakaru and similar programs.

I've been using it for a while, but it hasn't really been updated for a while. I vaguely recall that this is because the developers, Emiliana and Deat, have decided to move onto other things. I'm not sure if this is correct though.

However, VSeeFace doesn't have a Linux build and when I first started using VSF I found that the built-in webcam tracking didn't work when running under WINE. So I needed to run [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace), or OSF, to feed VSF tracking data. According to the github page for OpenSeeFace, it's the tracking application used for VTube Studio and is made by the same people who made VSF.
