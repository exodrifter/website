I've been researching techwear recently, in part for design inspiration for my new VTuber avatar but also because I'm interested in wearing stuff like that as well. I had asked my friend about techwear, and [HAMCUS](https://hamc.us/) was one of the brands that came up.

Well, apparently they ended up actually buying a few products. According to them, the products are of good quality, use multiple different fabrics, and have an impressive amount of detail.
