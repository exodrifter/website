Music lesson:
- I'm really frustrated with writing math rock, I feel like I'm not making anything that's good. I feel close to giving up on it for now.
- A nice way to learn any music genre would be to use a drum loop for the genre, and use that as scaffolding or as practice.

	- Add more dissonance (like 2nd and 9ths).
	- Math rock melodies tends to be more angular (more jumps and intervals) instead of smoothly stepping between notes.
	- Change the phrasing by using syncopation to shift notes off beat.
	- The drum loop they're using sounds a bit too much like a bridge or transition instead of a groove.
- The melody doesn't need to match up with the kick.
- Make a bass that matches up with the kick.
