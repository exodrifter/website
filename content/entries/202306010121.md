I copied over my Streaming Flight Check checklist, and it feels like it would be nice to be able to check the boxes in edit mode, but I'm not sure how to easily reset all of the checkboxes.

According to [this forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/check-and-uncheck-all-checkboxes/204/6), the shortcut for doing so is to select all of the lines and pressing `ctrl+enter`. I tried this in both edit mode and read mode, but it didn't work.

However, it seems that the functionality still exists as the keybind setting named `Toggle checkbox status` but the default keybinding is different now. Highlighting all of the lines in edit mode before pressing the default keybinding `ctrl+l` seems to work correctly. It doesn't work as expected if one of the lines is not a checkbox.
