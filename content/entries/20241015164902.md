Sending out playtests for v0.26 today, and I realized I haven't recorded what I've sent for past playtests. Here's what I've sent before:

```
Here are the instructions:

You've expressed interest in playtesting! If you would like to playtest the game, please play the game, record yourself playing it with a hot mic, and fill out a post-play questionnaire. If you want to stream it, feel free to (let me know and i'll try to drop by :heart:). You can send me the video recording and post-play questionnaire however you wish. I may retain the video recording for a few days in order to analyze it, but I will not store it perpetually.

Here are the builds: **PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THESE BUILDS**
- [Windows]()
- [Mac]()
- [Linux]()

After playing, please fill out this questionnaire:
- What platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) are you playing on?
- What is the story of the game? What is the game about? What are you doing in the game?
- What do you think you would do next? What do you want to do next?
- Did you run into anything buggy or confusing? What were they?
- After having played the demo, how much longer would you expect the full game take to play? How much would you expect the full game to cost?
- Any other feedback you'd like to provide?
- I will credit you as a playtester, if you wish. How do you want to be credited?
```

I need to update this a bit for the new playtest:

```
Please record yourself playing the game with a hot mic, and fill out a post-play questionnaire. This build is very rough and many things are missing; there is _not_ a definite spot where the game "ends" in this build. I would like to suggest playing no longer than 1.5 hours.

**DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THESE BUILDS** and **DO NOT STREAM**.

Here are the builds: <link>

You can upload the recording here: <link>

I've also included a save file `save.bin`. To use the save file, place it in the following directory:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\exodrifter\no-signal\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/exodrifter/no-signal/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/exodrifter/no-signal/`

After playing, please fill out this questionnaire:
- What platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) are you playing on?
- How would you describe the layout of the station?
- What are your goals in the game?
- Where do you want to go next?
- Did you run into anything buggy or confusing? What were they?
- Any other feedback you'd like to provide?
- I will credit you as a playtester, if you wish. How do you want to be named in the credits?
```
