More bugs for no signal reported by a player:
- [ ] When zoomed in, scrollbar and back arrow fight over input
- [ ] Bed frame disappears in 1g
- [ ] energy-b has a cable poking through screen
- [ ] Exercise bike pedals are not on opposite sides
- [ ] AA battery in energy lab is too small

Also I realized I forgot again to replace the power dialog still in radio-a.
