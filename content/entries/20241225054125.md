I learned about the B612 font recently. It is a font which, in addition to being designed specifically to "improve the display of information on the cockpit screens", was open sourced by Airbus in 2017 under the Eclipse Public License and in 2018 under the OFL. [^1]

I think it might be nice to update my website to use this font, because:
- I like the way it looks.
- I want my website to have a "NASA-punk" aesthetic, and I feel a font specifically designed by the aerospace industry would be a good reference.
