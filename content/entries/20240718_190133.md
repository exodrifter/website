Streamed _voluntary commitment_:
- Fixed some minor copy issues:
	- "Want do you want to know" should be "What do you want to know" in Lemon dialog.
	- "gourd" is not capitalized in Berry dialog.
- Fixed some warden character themes not looping.
- Added voice actors to credits.
- Couldn't figure out why the current screen doesn't change when the window is maximized or fullscreened when calling `window_set_current_screen`. Maybe there's a bug in Godot? I wasn't able to find any relevant open issues in the Godot GitHub repository.
- Add "The End" scene instead of exiting game immediately when the game ends.
- Add new text speed setting.
- Fix tranquilium text effect never going away.
