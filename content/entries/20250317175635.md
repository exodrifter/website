_no signal_ stream 185:
- Copied TODOs from [20250314045802](20250314045802.md)
- Did some research on how to represent a rubix cube in the game:
	- [Representing a Rubix Cube in APL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/384283.801107) by Howard A. Peelle. The 54-element Vector representation seems like the best option to me.
	- [Rubix cube solver in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/rubiks-cube-solver-96fa6c56fbe4/) by Ben Bellerose
	- Got distracted looking at a [2x2x2x2 4D Rubix Cube puzzle](https://superliminal.com/cube/2x2x2x2/) made by Melinda Green
