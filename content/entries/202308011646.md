Second chord progression: Esus2 Am (second inversion) Bm C

I said that I tried writing this in `Emaj` but it became `Emin` instead. He noted that ending on C reminded him of a Bulgarian cadence style, which frequently uses VI -> I. He showed me a video on YouTube titled "Cosmic voices from Bulgaria & Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra: Zaspalo e Chelebiiche".

He showed that it was possible to play E major as the first chord in the progression as well, to make it a modal mixture, and I liked that better (though he also added additional leading tones, so there might be more to it).

No assignment this week.
