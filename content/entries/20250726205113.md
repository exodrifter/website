Working on no signal on stream:
- Copied TODOs from [20250722201506](20250722201506.md)
- Collected all of the bug reports for no signal since release yesterday too.

TODOs:
- [ ] Old wordmark still shows up in the credits of the game
- [ ] One player reported a game freeze which happens inconsistently when accessing the EVA computer, regardless of how many attachments have been added to the probe.

	- Couldn't find a likely cause for this issue and cannot reproduce.
