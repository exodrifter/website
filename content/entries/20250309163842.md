At the 4th annual ATX GameMakers showcase at Valhalla showing _no signal_. This is the first event where the game is playable with controller, so I have it on the Steam Deck for demoing.

Players: 17
Finished: 1

Things I need to fix (might already have these TODOs, but wrote them down anyway just in case i missed them before):
- [ ] Add a way to invoke the hint button on con
- [ ] Hover state should go away when mouse is hidden or captured
- [ ] Don't recreate objects in chat log when drive is decrypted
- [ ] Add a button for next/previous drive when mounting drives
- [ ] Add support for map, notes, reset camera
- [ ] Sensitivity range goes too high and mot enough detail for lower values
- [ ] Sensitivity setting is unreadable at small values
- [ ] Add gyro control support
- [ ] Wire in comms is null
- [ ] Right click after removing broken drive?
- [ ] Up/down in chat log needs to work with both analog and dpad
- [ ] Make the entire drive bay clickable so it is easier to click on for controller and touch inputs
- [ ] Right click and escape dont work on title screen
- [ ] Don't use mouse warp by default, becuase of Wayland
- [ ] Let zoom out work for exiting screen
- [ ] maybe use dpad for moving circuits in puzzle?
