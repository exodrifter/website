Obsidian Notes are Markdown files, but Markdown is not a widely-standardized format. However, the creators of Obsidian wanted maximum compatibility with as many Markdown formats as possible. As a result, they have their own Markdown flavor called Obsidian Flavored Markdown.

It has the following characteristics:
* It implements the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) spec
* It implements some functionality from [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (unsure how much exactly)
* It implements some functionality from LaTeX (unsure how much exactly)
* It adds additional syntax:
  * `[[ ]]` for internal links
  * `![[ ]]` for embedding files
  * `%%` for comments
  * `> [!note]` for callouts
* It does not support Markdown or blank lines within HTML blocks
