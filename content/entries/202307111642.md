My assignment is 100% correct! We're talking about chord extensions today.

`C7` is a dominant chord because it uses the dominant scale.

Scale | Intervals
---|---
Major | WWHWWWH
Dominant | WWHWWHW
Minor | WHWWHWW

`C6` is good at being emotional and tugging on heartstrings. It's ambiguous, in part because it's also an `Amin7`.

`Csus4` and `Csus2` mean to play the fourth or second note respectively without playing the third note. These feel like they are in suspension and usually resolve to the tonic chord.

`add` adds a note, for example `Cmaj7add4` means `CEFGB`

`omit` removes a note, for example `C7omit5` means `CEB`
