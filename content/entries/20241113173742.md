Music lesson today

Suggestions for how to improve _idea_
- Do additional drum processing
- Swap or add another snare that is crunchier. Could just be a distortion effect
- Change rhythm of the Reese sampling hits, move it to the "and"
- Add some kind of constant, driving melodic layer, like 16th steps. Automate pitch shifts to vary it
- I tried adding more melodic content as a response to the Reese sampling hits, but I didn't like it. I could try adding more percussive elements instead, like a lower pitch snare.
- Add more drum elements, like an open hi-hat
- I could keep repeating the same thing as long as I keep adding more layers

I want to learn more about the royal road chord progression, and my teacher recommended listening to Jizue.
