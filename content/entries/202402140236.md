Working on improved lyrics/song structure for lonely-love:

> **Verse 1:**
> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> so i can remember how it went
> in my lonely love
> 
> **Chorus 1:**
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i tried to fix my ways but things remain the same
> 
> **Verse 2:**
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> in my lonely love
> 
> **Pre-chorus 1:**
> x-ray, my mind
> your gaze, those eyes
> heart pierced, how kind
> i cried, many times
> 
> **Chorus 1:**
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i tried to fix my ways but things remain the same
> 
> **Verse 1:**
> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> so i can remember how it went
> in my lonely love
> 
> **Pre-chorus 2:**
> online, ghost touch
> your voice, that sound
> held close, so much
> warm tears, i drowned
> 
> **Chorus 2:**
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> don't know when you'll stay but things were always strange
> i tried to fix my ways
> but things remain the same
