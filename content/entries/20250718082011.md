I realized that I probably need to start updating my list of Godot streamers again.

earend hasn't been working on [Hello, This Is Bear](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2645770/Hello_This_Is_Bear) recently. Instead, he's been working on a balatro/tower defense fusion game called [Bear Defense Situation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3778320/Bear_Defence_Situation/)
