How have cadences been used in the last 100 years?

Listening to *All the Things You Are* Hammerstein/Kern

Lead sheet contain chords and melody

Jazz uses the "real book" which is a collection of jazz standards, and it's a collection of lead sheets

`251` refers to the chord progression `ii -> V7 -> I`

They are often chained together, the `I` is changed to minor and treated as the `ii` chord for the next `251`.

It also becomes the `vi` chord and then followed by `251`

tritone substitution allows can be thought of allowing you to jump out of a key

sequencing is when you have the same chord progression but in a different key

lots of jazz music like big band plays the lead sheet twice, which is why they are usually exactly 3 minutes long

I'm being assigned the music _Afternoon in Paris_ by John Lewis, I need to outline the `251`s with parenthesis. I can do that by looking for major 7ths and working backwards
