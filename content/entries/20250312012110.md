Working on my music homework from [20250305164128](20250305164128.md). I want to chart out the sections of _[Got To Be Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPfFQ7Zhu88)_:

Hey!

(Verse)
Too slow
Saw you and it only took a second for me to know, hey
That I want you bad
Tell you before you go

(Pre-chorus)
Seeing you
I swear there's somethin' so familiar
Like I've known you all this time
Got to, got to, got to be mine

(Chorus)
If you want it, you can get it
If you feel it, you should let it
If you're leaving, you should let me know

If you're dancin', I'm a dancer
If you'll risk it, I'm a chancer
Got a question? I'm the answer, oh

I saw you, now you, got to, got to be mine

(Verse)
Keep up
I call it like I see it and you look just like I dreamed it, hey
Yeah you got a face like film grain
If you, leave that's a shame

(Pre-chorus)
Seeing you
I swear thеre's somethin' so familiar
Like I'vе known you all this time
Got to, got to, got to be mine

Seeing you
I swear there's somethin' so familiar
Like I've known you all this time
Got to, got to, got to be mine

(Chorus)
If you want it, you can get it
If you feel it, you should let it
If you're leaving, you should let me know

If you're dancin', I'm a dancer
If you'll risk it, I'm a chancer
Got a question? I'm the answer, oh

I saw you, now you, got to, got to be mine

(Pre-chorus)
Seeing you
I swear there's somethin' so familiar
Like I've known you all this time
Got to, got to, got to be mine
