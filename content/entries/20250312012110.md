Working on my music homework from [20250305164128](20250305164128.md). I want to chart out the sections of _[Got To Be Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPfFQ7Zhu88)_:

Hey!

(Verse)<br/>
Too slow<br/>
Saw you and it only took a second for me to know, hey<br/>
That I want you bad<br/>
Tell you before you go<br/>

(Pre-chorus)<br/>
Seeing you<br/>
I swear there's somethin' so familiar<br/>
Like I've known you all this time<br/>
Got to, got to, got to be mine<br/>

(Chorus)<br/>
If you want it, you can get it<br/>
If you feel it, you should let it<br/>
If you're leaving, you should let me know<br/>

If you're dancin', I'm a dancer<br/>
If you'll risk it, I'm a chancer<br/>
Got a question? I'm the answer, oh<br/>

I saw you, now you, got to, got to be mine

(Verse)<br/>
Keep up<br/>
I call it like I see it and you look just like I dreamed it, hey<br/>
Yeah you got a face like film grain<br/>
If you, leave that's a shame<br/>

(Pre-chorus)<br/>
Seeing you<br/>
I swear thеre's somethin' so familiar<br/>
Like I'vе known you all this time<br/>
Got to, got to, got to be mine<br/>

Seeing you<br/>
I swear there's somethin' so familiar<br/>
Like I've known you all this time<br/>
Got to, got to, got to be mine<br/>

(Chorus)<br/>
If you want it, you can get it<br/>
If you feel it, you should let it<br/>
If you're leaving, you should let me know<br/>

If you're dancin', I'm a dancer<br/>
If you'll risk it, I'm a chancer<br/>
Got a question? I'm the answer, oh<br/>

I saw you, now you, got to, got to be mine

(Pre-chorus)<br/>
Seeing you<br/>
I swear there's somethin' so familiar<br/>
Like I've known you all this time<br/>
Got to, got to, got to be mine<br/>
