To create a one-shot delay timer in Godot without creating a node, reference the following example, which creates a `SceneTreeTimer` by using `SceneTree`'s `create_timer` method:

```gdscript
func some_function():
    print("Timer started.")
    await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
    print("Timer ended.")
```
