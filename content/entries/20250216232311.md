I found a Barotrauma video that went over some stuff I didn't notice while playing casually and browsing the official wiki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4BdLh4NeYs

In particular, the one I didn't know about is that I should place containers in the output of deconstructors. Deconstructors will dump items into containers in the output, if they exist.
