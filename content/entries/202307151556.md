Encountered a weird problem in Godot. Consider the following code:

```gdscript
class_name VoiceBanks

const banks: Dictionary = {
		"lemon": preload("res://prefabs/voice_player/voices/ava.tres")
	}

static func lookup(key: String) -> VoiceBank:
	if banks.has(key):
		return banks[key]
	else:
		return null
```

`lookup`, even though it successfully finds the right `VoiceBank` resource, fails with the error `Trying to return value of type "Resource" from a function which the return type is "VoiceBank".`

However, delaying the load until later works:

```gdscript
class_name VoiceBanks

const banks: Dictionary = {
		"lemon": "res://prefabs/voice_player/banks/ava.tres"
	}

static func lookup(key: String) -> VoiceBank:
	if banks.has(key):
		return load(banks[key])
	else:
		return null
```

I'm not really sure why this is, but I'm guessing it has something to do with how Godot treats `const` values.
