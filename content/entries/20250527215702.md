Working on _no signal_ at MADE coworking:
- Copied TODOs from [20250521170546](20250521170546.md)
- I need to implement achievements in the game so that they can be seen without having Steam installed
- I managed to fill all of the medical drawers today, so I think tanuki must have finished the extra models for the medical room.

Tanuki:
- [ ] Make Naoko's charm model
- [ ] ~~Switch velcro mats to something more "traditional"?~~ I'm going to drop this. Tanuki wanted to change this to make it easier for players to find the velcro mats, but it appears that the playtesters are figuring it out okay.
- [ ] Bobby-fy `meeting-a plan`
- [x] Make models to fill drawers in medical room
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in workshop
- [ ] Decal pass all of the rooms

TODO:
- [ ] Don't move camera when changing selection in popup menus using the D-Pad
- [ ] Can't use touchscreen when steam deck is in controller input mode in desktop mode
- [ ] Analog stick moves puzzle selection too quickly
- [x] Add achievements
- [x] Update testing instructions to include chess piece locations (See [20250103194331](20250103194331.md))
- [ ] Test achievements
- [ ] Test Steam achievements
- [ ] Test cloud save
- [ ] Missing hover sound when in fps mode and hovering over door
- [x] [#50 lab_energy - Clicking unlock on the computer does not display password prompt](https://git.tsuki.games/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/50)
- [ ] [#51 ESC menu - "Exit to title" button exits to desktop](https://git.tsuki.games/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/51)
- [ ] Now that there are achievements, it's possible to "soft-lock" the achievement state and make it impossible to get a 100% state after a certain point. It would be nice to give the player some way to go back to part 2.
