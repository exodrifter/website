Music Lesson:
- Talking about _in the move_
- Might have to try different ways of recording the word "move" or "hands" and "insight"
- People often use a plugin series called RX11 by Izotope for vocal mixing
- Could turn down the volume of vocals overall by 2 dB
- Do a more extreme EQ on two of the vocal tracks so that the overlapping frequencies don't pile up.
- Vocal volume is good in the first verse, chorus is too loud.
- Instrumental bridge is loud compared to the rest of the track.
- Snare is too loud in the end of the song

	- The vocal mixing on this track is good
