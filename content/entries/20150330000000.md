This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Access is a short visual novel where you play as Knight, who is looking for a person named Ave. You have the special ability to read the minds of others, but this leads to interesting and unobvious consequences...

This game was made for the EGaDS Narrative Game Jam in March 2015 in under 24 hours.
