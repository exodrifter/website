I was trying to figure out why my GitHub deployment for my website stopped working with the following error:

```
Fetching LFS objects
  /usr/bin/git lfs fetch origin refs/remotes/origin/main
  fetch: Fetching reference refs/remotes/origin/main
  batch response: This repository exceeded its LFS budget. The account responsible for the budget should increase it to restore access.
  batch response: This repository exceeded its LFS budget. The account responsible for the budget should increase it to restore access.
  batch response: This repository exceeded its LFS budget. The account responsible for the budget should increase it to restore access.
  batch response: This repository exceeded its LFS budget. The account responsible for the budget should increase it to restore access.
  Error: error: failed to fetch some objects from 'https://github.com/exodrifter/website.git/info/lfs'
  The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 2
  Waiting 10 seconds before trying again
```

I would see this error three times before the workflow failed. I recall that I pay for additional LFS budget, but the billing cycle just started again recently and I don't think I've exceeded the limit. It took me a while to find the usage, but it appears this month I've used 9.87 GB bandwidth and 390.31 GB-hr of storage. However, I'm not able to find my quota because it appears that the interface for billing has changed. Reading the docs, [the instructions to increase my LFS quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/upgrading-git-large-file-storage) don't work since it's still for the old interface.

Reading [the about page for LFS billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/about-billing-for-git-large-file-storage), I find out that I get 10 GB of bandwidth and storage for free, but I still don't have any information about how to manage my quota. After some poking around, I tried adjusting my "LFS budget" on the [`Settings > Billing and Licensing > Budgets and alerts`](https://github.com/settings/billing/budgets) page to $5 and re-running the job. That seemed to work.
