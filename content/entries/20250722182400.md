There's a good [XKCD comic about file transfers](https://xkcd.com/949/) about how we still haven't figured out how to do it. [XKCD licensing](https://xkcd.com/license.html) would allow me to copy the comic onto my website, but I think I'll just link to it from my website instead.

The caption at the bottom of the comic reads:

> I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet "sending files" is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do.

Despite the age of the comic, I still think this is true.
