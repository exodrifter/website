Had a long conversation in my discord server today about a potential new adult game that I wanted to summarize the ideas here:

- You play as a mechanic that is maintaining their robot girlfriend and it's very intimate
- You have a manual detailing how to do the steps, and your robot girlfriend reacts in different ways as you perform the steps.
- The game takes place in first person, from the perspective of the mechanic
- Fix wiring, change attachments, replace parts
- Rebooting a robot forcefully could feel like involuntarily passing out, a graceful shutdown is like going to sleep.
- We only need assets to create the 3d scene and the robot model
- We could add alternate robot models, such as a robot boyfriend (or anything else really)
- It would be cool to make this into a multiplayer VR game where one person plays the robot and another plays the mechanic, but I think for now we should just scope this as a short 1 month gamejam game.
- Various repair scenarios could be either sfw or nsfw depending on what they are about, but we could choose just the sfw ones for now.
- We could take inspiration from [wormz](https://www.tumblr.com/k0nstanta), who I followed on cohost! for a while.
	- They made a game called _[>meow](https://cohost.org/mrows/post/7512685-div-style-backgrou)_
	- They made a zine that can be purchased [here](https://hipolink.me/mrows/products/meow-digital-art-zine).
	- Refueling lubricant more often than usual: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/7088189-i-ve-gotten-a-simila
	- Technical manuals can range from romantic to arousing, depending on the quality of the technical manual: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/7008436-i-don-t-think-it-wou
	- Technical diagrams are like looking at erotic nude photos: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/6945365-i-d-say-she-finds-te
	- Modifying the programming can be ticklish: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/6555661-please-don-t-mess-ar
	- A robot that knows itself well can top another robot that doesn't know itself that well yet: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/6157694-it-s-highly-improbab
	- Robots like being called things: https://cohost.org/mrows/post/6081828-she-s-kind-of-into-i

We also discussed briefly the idea of letting the player choose to become a robot using mind upload, and I thought it would be nice if when this happened the player asked the robot they've been maintaining to do it for them:

> robot: I see you've been building another body, but you're taking such good care of mine... what is it for?
> robot: oh, i see... so you... want to be like me too?
> robot: i can help you with that, if you want.
> 
> MAKE A CHOICE:
> a) mind upload
> b) mind upload

Gabby suggested the name _right to repair_, and I like that name so that's what I'll call it for now.
