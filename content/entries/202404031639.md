- Turn voices down, cut the low end on the verse so the arpeggio can be heard more clearly.
- Cut lows out completely for the chorus.
- To mix vocals, turn down the music until you can barely hear it. You should still be able to hear the vocals clearly as well as everything that plays under it. If you can only hear one, it should be rebalanced.
- Turn down hi-hat. It sounds loud because it's a higher pitch.
- I could turn up the base and make it more beefy
