Trying to figure out how to do partial function application in Godot. Apparently, Godot has support for lambda functions:

```gdscript
func make_filter(max: int) -> Callable:
	var l := func filter(val: int):
		return val < max
	return l
```

I used this accordingly to partially apply a function:
```gdscript
func clip_outlines()
	# ...

	# The solid area was untouched by the hole
	elif result.any(func(area): return are_outlines_equal(solid, area)):
		print ("\tsolid area untouched...")
		pass
```
