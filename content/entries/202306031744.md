Making Cornbread today.

- 1 1/4 cup of cornmeal, measured at 220 grams
- 1 cup of all-purpose flour, measured at 152 grams. Curious ehat other flour types would taste like.
- 1 tbsp baking powder, measured at 3 grams
- 1 more tbsp of baking powder since i have no baking soda, meared at 2 more grams for 5 grams total. I wonder how different it tastes with baking soda.
- 1 tsp of kosher salt, measured at 5 grams
- 3/8 cup of miyoko' creamery european-style cultured vegan butter (1/8 more because im just trying to get rid of the butter)
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk measured at 240g
- 1 tbsp 5% acidity apple cider vinegar measured at 5g
- added only 1 jalapeno
- i forgot to grease the pan. oh well.

After 20m at 400F, cornbread seems a little pale but sticking a knife through comes out clean. it tastes a bit grainy and unevenly mixed. I wonder what I did wrong. I do know that the cornmeal is different than the one I normally use, but I got rid of the original packaging when i put it in another container so I have no idea what it is.

I think the uneven flavor is because of the kosher salt. I should mix kosher salt into the wet ingredients so it can be mixed more evenly.
