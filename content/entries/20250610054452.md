A playtester for _no signal_ mentioned some kind of z-fighting issue in the center, and it reminded me of an issue I looked into before related to decals (see [20240618194223](../entries/20240618194223.md)). However, upon re-reading the issue, I see a better workaround:

Sure enough, changing the decal to use uniform scaling fixes the issue, even for decals with non-uniform size
