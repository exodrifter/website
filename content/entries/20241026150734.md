Trying again to figure out how to use my notes on my phone. I dont use Obsidian Sync anymore because it costed money and its ability to track history was worse than git's.

I'm pretty happy with my workflow on desktop, but I don't know how to get the files onto my phone. There used to be a git client for android called [Agit](https://github.com/rtyley/agit) but it hasnt been updated in a decade.

I had the idea that there might be a linux terminal for android that could be used to install git, so I searched for a terminal in the Google app store. I found [Termux](https://termux.dev), which can do that!

I was able to install git with:

```sh
apt install git
```
