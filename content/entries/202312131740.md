Talking about the lyrics I wrote

> looking for the message you've sent me
> or the pictures of better times
> guessing all the things that i'd say back
> for this unrequited love

Suggested in the next half of the verse, that I try rhyming the last line. Have steps of removal from the actual event; don't be like _The Christmas Shoes_.

Suggestions:
- "or the pictures of better times" -> "or the pictures i thought i took"
- allowing yourself one or two lines to be literal about what you're singing about is fine. moments of grounding are fine as long as we don't stay there.
- Consider exploring other words to let listeners get more different meanings out of the song; "unrequited love" is specific, which can be good if I want the listeners to get a specific meaning.

Homework:
- Do another four lines
- Think about the moments that made my unrequited loves special
- Find out if I can have a lesson Christmas week
