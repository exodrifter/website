Watching "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" by Casey Muratori. 

At the end of the talk, Casey explains that the Sketchpad program had both virtual functions and an entity component system. However, because of the inclinations of developers at the experience from having worked in distributed system and molecular biology, they were biased into preferring the virtual function inheritance model over the entity component system.

So, between the time of Sketchpad at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1963 and Thief at Looking Glass in 1998, there's a 35 year gap where there wasn't much work being done on ECS-like approaches, which is where the name of the talk comes from.
