Watching "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" by Casey Muratori. 

Apparently, the Simula developers Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl credit the idea of subclasses to C.A.R. Hoare, the inventor of quicksort, in particular the 1966 paper "Record Handling".

This was back during the time when academics were talking about parsing computer language and human language. So, Hoare suggested the idea of representing classes of objects in the real world with mutually exclusive subclasses.

This feels like an ontological categorization problem to me, where people try to sort concepts into folders instead of using tags. I do not like sorting things into folders and subfolders. Maybe this is another reason I really hate OOP.

The dates seem a bit weird here though; the talk says thta Simula was made in 1963, but this paper was not published until 1966.

In the same paper, they mention the idea of "record class discriminator\[s\]", which Casey points out is similar to the idea of tagged union types.
