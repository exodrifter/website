Working on _no signal_ offline today.

TODOs:
- [20250807205339](20250807205339.md)
	- Probably won't fix these:
		- [ ] Game crashes sometimes when clicking on something off the game's window, like OBS, after idling in the game after 10-15 minutes [20250805220309](20250805220309.md)
		- [ ] For some reason, the corners of the black hole skybox are darker.
		- [ ] Old wordmark still shows up in the credits of the game.
		- [ ] A player reported a lighting issue in the center, where it loads in completely dark while playing a game. This only happened on the user's computer once after the initial install.
