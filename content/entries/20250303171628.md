_no signal_ stream 177:
- Copied TODOs from [20250228192248](20250228192248.md)
- Copied power diagram from [20250225173548](20250225173548.md)
- Found out how to batch export Krita files: [20250303201836](20250303201836.md)
- Upgraded to Godot 4.4

Right now in the game, each pair of circuits which solve the puzzle are in different rooms, but I have this problem where each power source is not shared with any of the circuits. 

```
150  200  250  300  350
││├───┘├─────────────┘
││A    B   │    │
│├─────────┘    │
│C              │
├───────────────┘
D
```

I also think it's going to be hard to explain that shared power sources are not double counted, so I think I should make them all separate. The new power source values should then be:

- A: 100, 150
- B: 200, 250
- C: 350, 100
- D: 150, 100
