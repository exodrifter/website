After I brought up _A Mathematician's Lament_ in my server, someone in my server linked this game called [Euclidea](https://www.euclidea.xyz/) which lets you solve geometric problems interactively.

I tried to play it for a bit. At first the game didn't make any sense -- until I realized that the banner at the bottom was close-able. Once I closed the banner, it revealed that it was covering up the controls for switching between tools. There were a few other weird UX issues after that, but overall it was a nicer experience after that. I didn't get very far, but I enjoyed the puzzles and even after the first few problems I feel like I've learned a few things.

I think it would be nice to compile a list of math games that embrace math as being a core enjoyable mechanic of the game, rather than gamifying the experience as if math is merely a bitter pill to tolerate.
