Watching _lost contact_ playthrough:

- [x] People don't like right click opening the menu.
- [x] Match drive eye icon to color of drive status
- [x] Add shift+middle mouse for panning
- [ ] Speed up upload animation after you see it the first few times
- [x] Add backspace to safe
- [ ] Add panning sensitivity
- [ ] Add count of fuses to inventory
- [x] Replace `--` with em dash
- [x] Four ellipses in dialog

Unsure how to address:
- [ ] Add a time somehow

Make the dialog more interesting by using corruption or cutting off the dialog when it starts getting interesting
