At 2025-07-28 12:47-0700, Leaf posted [an announcement in the `#news` channel](https://discord.com/channels/98142307840200704/375351908577312770/1399478462787489873) in the official itch.io discord server stating that an addendum FAQ had been added to their original blog post about NSFW content.

The addendum can be read here: https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq

In it, they talk about a few things, including:
- Why their response was greater than Steam's
- That Stripe can no longer be used for 18+ content.
- That you can still access deindexed games and games that you have already purchased in your library or collections.
