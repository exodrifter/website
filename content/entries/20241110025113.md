Learned about the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) 10-Year Lunar Architecture Capability Study, which is exploring potential lunar infrastructure for supporting a sustainable commercial economy. They requested ideas in August 2023.

Northrop Grumman submitted a proposal to that study in June 2024, suggesting the use of a lunar rail network.

> “It’s all conceptual, but we’re leveraging prior studies and working with partners like the Colorado School of Mines,” Steven said. “Under our concept, the railroad would be entirely built by robots.”

There are several benefits that a rail system would provide, according to Northrop Grumman:
- It would not kick up dust like rovers
- It would avoid littering the surface of mars with vehicles that are left behind

However, the study is still challenged by uncertainties around lunar soil composition and the extreme temperatures around -200 Celsius.
