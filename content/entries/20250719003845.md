I had written down that Toronto Games Expo happens biannually, but that's ambiguous -- is it twice a year or every two years? Their [about page](https://www.torontogameexpo.ca/contact) says:

> The Toronto Game Expo (TGE) is the city’s premier event for gaming and pop culture enthusiasts! Held twice a year, TGE unites gamers, collectors, cosplayers, comic fans, and anime lovers for an unforgettable two-day experience filled with excitement, nostalgia, and community.

Also looking up the word on [wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/words/biannual), I see that there's actually two words that are more specific:

> **biannual**
> Definitions from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.
> - *adjective* Occurring twice each year; semiannual.
> - *adjective* Occurring every two years; biennial.

So I think I should use semiannual instead.
