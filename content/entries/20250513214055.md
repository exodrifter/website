I wanted to find out more information about when the _Capitalism and Gay Identity_ essay was written, and I found [a Jacobin interview](https://jacobin.com/2020/08/gay-identity-capitalism-lgbt) of the author which states that the first draft was written in 1979.

Also, the interview links to an online version of the essay at http://sites.middlebury.edu/sexandsociety/files/2015/01/DEmilio-Capitalism-and-Gay-Identity.pdf
