Music Lesson:
- Listening to _petrichor slices_
	- Teacher suggested increasing the tempo
	- Add some texture to the bass note
- Mathcore is about creating an irregular, unusual rhythm, but making it normal through repetition
- Listening to [Never Meant by American Football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NfnXdXpjL0)
	- The bass notes here start off simple, following the chord progression
	- Later on in the song, the bass notes play more often
- [*shibuya* by Covet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGwVJCdV6A)
	- The bass notes here are more active, but they don't play all of the notes in the riff
- Teacher played a more active bass line as an example along with the existing track, and it sounds a lot more like mathcore now to me.
	- The bass line adds complexity because it's not playing the same thing as the melody
	- Could try jumping back and forth between the octaves or fifths
	- The bass has its own metric pattern that might end at the same time as the guitar riff
	- For something simpler, I could, wherever i start my riff again, put a new root note in the bass
- We talked briefly about "Free Jazz", which is usually a trio of people playing their own thing. They might start off with the same bass, but there's no written music or chord progression that they stick to.
