This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Tempus is a strategy game that I often fail to make, but learn a lot from trying to do so.

In the summer of 2013 I created a really simple prototype to test out how combat could work in the game.

Instructions for the prototype: Press R when a planet is selected to spawn ships and right click on a planet to send half of the troops from the selected planet. The player with the most points at the end of the game (when all planets are owned by one player) wins.
