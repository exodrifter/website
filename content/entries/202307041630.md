I made a lot of mistakes on my homework. This is because there are actually several different ways to write chords:

Name | Notation
---|--
Major | Cmaj7, Cma7, C△7
Dominant | C7
Minor | Cmin7, Cmi7, C-7

I made the mistake that the major and dominant chords were the same, but they are not. For example, a `Cmaj7` has the notes `C E G B` and a `C7` has the notes `C E G B♭`.

This is because chord notation uses scale degrees and not the minor or major intervals. Scale degrees and intervals are correlated and are sometimes the same, but they can also be different. For example, `Cmin9` would use the notes `C E♭ G B♭ D` and not `C E♭ G B♭ D♭`. Note the use of `D`, as it's the 9th scale degree even though the minor 9th is technically `D♭`

Slash chords add another arbitrary note to the bottom of the chord. For example, `Cmaj7/E` is `E C E G B`.

You can also think of `251`s as jumping 4ths between the root notes. For example, the `251` in Cmaj is D to G, then G to C.

Assignment: Find the `251`s in the keys Gmaj and Amaj
- Gmaj: Amin7 (A, C, E, G) -> D7 (D, F#, A, C) -> Gmaj7 (G, B, D, F#)
- Amaj: Bmin7 (B, D, F#, A) -> E7 (E, G#, B, D) -> Amaj7 (A, C#, E, G#)
