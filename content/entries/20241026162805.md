Fantastic Arcade 2024 notes:
- Showing version 0.25 of _no signal_
- Plays: 33
	- Room On: 28
	- Reactor: 10
	- Reactor On: 8
	- Elevator Chamber: 1
- Gave out cassettes for free, didn't keep count (between 10 and 20 I think)
	- Someone donated $10!
- Add elevator icon to reactor scene? People tend to think that the elevator card is for the EVA room
- People tend to double click on things, which cancels the camera movement. Maybe I can detect double clicks and handle them?
- Flash download button?
- Maybe I should add a clue to the environment about the comms card also working for the storage room?
- I brought the backup battery on a whim, but it ended up being useful since the Steam Deck dock appears to supply power unsteadily, causing the portable monitor to lose power/connection periodically. Connecting the monitor power to the backup battery resolved this issue.
