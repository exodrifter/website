Talking about the new lyrics for _lonely love_

The rhyming scheme is AABC, ABAB, AABC, ABAB. Though the rhyme scheme is being switched up and that can be neat, it could be better to keep the same rhyme scheme to establish the pattern.

For mixing, we generally want to slope the low end, dip the 1k and boost 2k and above.

high ends above 2k has the vocal texture and everything below that is usually muddy in vocals, especially with an ensemble.
