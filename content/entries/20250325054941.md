Was listening to *[Too Hot in L.A.](https://youtu.be/WoemMPPJ78s)* by Vulfpeck when i got inspired, also grabbed some inspiration from [20250321035428](20250321035428.md).

(verse)
our hands tight, walk with me
see the forest for the trees
you've got insight, you've got keys
to make me feel like i've been seen

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move, in the move
lost you in the move
lost you in the move

(verse)
fingers laced and pull me close
in your taste tell what matters most
you're so tender, it really shows
i need a mender, that's what i chose

(pre-chorus)
you feel so good, i'm alive
you say those words, its so sublime

i feel so good, it's arrived
i said some words, i meant in kind

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move, in the move
lost you in the move
lost you in the move

(bridge)
lets plan another
dont wanna be a bother
just say which whenever
i wont say no, never

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move, in the move
lost you in the move
lost you in the move

but i lost you in the move, in the move
lost you in the move
lost you in the move
