Was listening to *[Too Hot in L.A.](https://youtu.be/WoemMPPJ78s)* by Vulfpeck when i got inspired, also grabbed some inspiration from [20250321035428](20250321035428.md).

(verse)<br/>
our hands tight, walk with me<br/>
see the forest for the trees<br/>
you've got insight, you've got keys<br/>
to make me feel like i've been seen<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move, in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>

(verse)<br/>
fingers laced and pull me close<br/>
in your taste tell what matters most<br/>
you're so tender, it really shows<br/>
i need a mender, that's what i chose<br/>

(pre-chorus)<br/>
you feel so good, i'm alive<br/>
you say those words, its so sublime<br/>

i feel so good, it's arrived<br/>
i said some words, i meant in kind<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move, in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>

(bridge)<br/>
lets plan another<br/>
dont wanna be a bother<br/>
just say which whenever<br/>
i wont say no, never<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move, in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>

but i lost you in the move, in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>
lost you in the move<br/>
