Talking to Free Play, asking them about how they produced the gameboy carts they have on display:
- They use GB Studio to make the games
- An Australian company called Inside Gadgets sell the PCBs for Gameboy carts
- Recommend using the GBxCart RW for flashing
- Also suggested flashing to bootlegged carts instead of buying new pcbs, if buying new PCBs is too expensive.
- They crowdfund their production runs on Kickstarter
