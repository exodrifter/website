Reviewing the lyrics:
> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> so i can remember how it went
> in my lonely love
> 
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i don't know how you say things will never change
> 
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> in my lonely love

Suggestion:
- Try "i don't know how you say things remain the same"
- Try playing the chorus without the lyrics before doing it again with the lyrics
- Use different effect chains on different parts of the vocals
