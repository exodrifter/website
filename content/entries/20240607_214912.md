- Finished adding a workaround for some performance issues in Godot: [20240607_184945](20240607_184945.md)
- Finally got to work on other parts of the game today that aren't part of the demo! It's been a while.
- Fixed transforms and colors in all non-demo scenes
	- Next time we make a game, we need to introduce more stable ways of referencing which parts of the model get which colors. Right now, it's totally dependent on index positions, which makes it hard to keep the colors in the right place when models are updated.
- Updated the upper hallway rooms to connect to each other again.
	- Added the overlay prefab
	- Moved the `AnimatedOpenClose` to be under the collider when necessary
	- Replace `TransitionAction` with `AnimatedTransition`
