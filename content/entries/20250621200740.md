Visiting the Industry exhibit hall.

Saw the stand for BART
- Asked if they has many software jobs or not, since their website doesnt seem to have any software listings
	- They do, but it tends to come in waves. Recommended checking the careers page periodically for new listings. Also said it might take a while to get a reply because of government bueraucracy.

Saw the stand for Lloyd & Mousilli, Attourneys and Counselors at Law
- Lawyer VTuber community is small:
	- KonoTomo
	- LexParte
	- ElfPireEva
	- Sasabiyuu
- Asked how to determine if a law firm is good or not. Is there a place to go to see what people think?
	- There isn't really a good place. They rely on word of mouth.

Saw a stand for Mirrativ, which is a 2d vtuber character creation app. It seems like a quick way to get started with vtubing and creating a persona. https://miraava.com/avatar_customization
