This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

I performed quality assurance testing for Ms. Splosion Man, a sidescrolling 3D platforming game made by Twisted Pixel Games by filing new bugs and doing regression testing, among other things.

To be honest, I'm not really sure how much I can say about my work on this game (In fact, I'm not absolutely sure if I can use that image you see above. I believe it's covered under fair use, though.); however, I can say it was a very fun experience and I really enjoyed working with the folks over at Twisted Pixel Games.

The game was released in April 2013, and you can get the game at a variety of places which are all linked to on the [url=http://mssplosionman.com/]official site[/url].
