Watching [acvalens](https://www.twitch.tv/acvalens) react to a Vaush video on Twitch right now. She mentioned at one point that her understanding was that all content with the `NSFW` tag was deindexed. I had previously thought that it was all content with the `adult` tag in [20250724213052](20250724213052.md).

Checking itch.io, I can see only three games with the `NSFW` tag right now, so I think this is more correct.
