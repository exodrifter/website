Noting additional godot crimes during stream:
- `self == null` during `_notification(NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE)` https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/31166 and https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/80834
- What does it mean to call `get_viewport().mark_input_as_handled()` after `await`ing in a input handler callback? Or outside of an input handler, like in `process(_delta)`?
