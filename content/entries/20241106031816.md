For my website's git repository, I actually host it on two remotes -- one which is publicly accessible on GitHub and another private one in Gitea. I pushed a draft post containing images to the Gitea repository, but when I tried to open this branch on another computer it was unable to find the images:

```
$ git checkout fantastic_arcade

```

Checking the computer where I originally pushed the branch, the LFS files exist locally and have already been pushed to the Gitea server.

As it turns out, this was because Git (version 2.47.0) was trying to pull the assets from the GitHub server despite the fact that the branch was pushed to the Gitea server. To fix this, I needed to manually direct Git to download the files from the Gitea remote before checking out the branch:

```sh
git lfs fetch --all gitea
git checkout fantastic_arcade
```

Looking into this more, it appears this happens because `git` does not supply remote information to `git lfs`, so it has to assume the remote that you're using:

> [technoweenie @ github, git-lfs/git-lfs#1759](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1759#issuecomment-266463409)
>
> Git's internal hooks don't supply remote info to Git LFS, so we have to assume the default branch.

> [technoweenie @ github, git-lfs/git-lfs#436](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/436)
>
> Git LFS has no idea what remote was pulled from in the smudge command, so it defaults to `origin`.
