Music lesson, talking about mastering:
- You can put a basic master on things and it will generally sound pretty good, but you can always dig into it more
- It's probably good enough to apply the same mastering preset to all of the tracks to bring them up to the same volume level
- Recommends exporting the track and then doing mastering to it in a separate project
- I could try adding an exciter to the stack, like Ozone 11 Exciter
- The exciter can be used to add a saturation effect to a specific frequency
