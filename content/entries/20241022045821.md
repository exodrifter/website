I want to add to my playtesting notes that it is important for a player to record themselves playing the game with a hot mic. I know from experience in past projects that the honest, in-the-moment reactions are invaluable for making the game better, especially when a playtester is completely new to the game. It is also very useful when players use the opportunity to say what they are thinking aloud as they play, as this gives me better insight into what they are thinking.
