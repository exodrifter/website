Quartz is a static site generator designed to transform markdown files into a website. In particular, it was originally designed as a way to publish Obsidian vaults, but it will work for any collection of markdown files and has support for other markup formats (see https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Obsidian-compatibility).

Generally, Quartz seems to cater more towards Obsidian users.
