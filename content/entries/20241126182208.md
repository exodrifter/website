Trying to learn what is going on with VRM/MediaPipe/etc so that I can contribute to SnekStudio.

- VRM is the model format standard
- MediaPipe is a tracking software by Google
- ARKit is a tracking software by Apple (SnekStudio does not presently use ARKit)
- [Unified Expressions](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes#ue-base-shapes) is an open source face expression standard

MediaPipe and ARKit both use the same shape keys, and a good description of all the shape keys can be found at this blog post: https://hinzka.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/12/21/222635

Apple also has documentation on the keys, but it generally does not explain a whole lot (for example, see Apple's [`browInnerUp` documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/2928264-browinnerup))
