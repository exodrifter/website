There are two ways to make an Obsidian Internal Link:

* Using the Wikilink format: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
* Using the Markdown format: `[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)`

You can also link to a specific heading of a note by using `#`. For example: `[[Three laws of motion#Second law]]`.
