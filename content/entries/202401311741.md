Reviewing the new lyrics for lonely-love:

> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> so i can remember how it went
> in my lonely love
> ﻿
> **x-ray, my mind**
> **your gaze, those eyes**
> **heart pierced, how kind**
> **i cried, many times**
> 
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i don't know how you say things will never change
> ﻿
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> in my lonely love

Could try doubling the length of the verse, stripping down the pre-chorus, and building it back up to the chorus:

> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i don't know how you say things will never change
> ﻿
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> in my lonely love
> 
> (4-bar verse with different lyrics)
> 
> x-ray, my mind
> your gaze, those eyes
> heart pierced, how kind
> i cried, many times
> 
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> i don't know how you say things will never change

As a rule of thumb, the second verse should _not_ use words in common with the first verse.

Example structure:
- verse 1
- chorus
- verse 2 (twice the length)
- pre-chorus (half the length of verse 2)
- chorus 2 (inject something new, bigger and more expansive)
- bridge
- verse 1
- prechorus (starts differently)
- chorus 3 (remove the ensemble)
