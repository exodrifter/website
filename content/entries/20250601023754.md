Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250531005230](20250531005230.md)

Level design:
- [ ] Add decals pages on activity room cork board
	- [ ] maybe add more information about how poltergeist works
	- [ ] maybe add information about replacement printer parts, like the printer head
- [ ] Add painting to 2G
- [ ] Label painting items in 2G

Misc:
- [ ] Test cloud save

Joystick:
- [ ] ~~Don't move camera when changing selection in popup menus using the D-Pad~~ The camera only moves when a new selection cannot be made in the direction that the user presses, so this works fine I think.
- [ ] Can't use touchscreen when steam deck is in controller input mode in desktop mode
- [x] Analog stick moves puzzle selection too quickly
- [ ] Missing hover sound when in fps mode and hovering over door
- [x] Add ability to scroll achievement list
- [x] Can't see mouse after moving it in rig puzzle when entering using joystick
- [ ] Can't switch easily between mouse and controller
