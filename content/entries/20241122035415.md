Watched the first episode of an action science-fiction anime called _**takt op.Destiny**_, which depicts a world in which music is no longer commonplace due to an alien invasion of monsters called D2s which are attracted to and aggravated by the sound of music.

I'm not sure that it counts as a paradigm shift anime from just the first episode. Even though the show only has a few moments that show the effect of the change, they are framed as describing a change that has already happened.

In particular:
- A mom explaining the exposition talks about how she would like to show her kids music some day, who don't know what it is.
- A person in the market remarking that they cannot remember the last time they have heard music
- The conductor complaining thay they want to play or listen to music, but they can't.
- Music instruments or music players having notes on them saying to not use them or to use them in some future point in time.
