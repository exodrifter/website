Trying to write a chord progression using two of the chords for the homework assigned to me at the last music lesson ([202309121640](202309121640.md)), but I'm having a little trouble putting them together in a way that sounds pleasing. I want to do a Lydian chord progression and there are only two particular chords we discussed at my last music lesson: `Fmaj7#11` and `F6#11`

However, these don't sound very different from each other, even when I try using a 251 chord progression with `maj7#11` for the 2 and 5 chords and the `F6#11` for the 1 chord. So, I decided to change the 1 chord to the `maj7#11` chord (so that the 251 chord progression all uses the same chord) and tried adding an additional chord from a different mode at the end.

I tried using the `Amin7` Aeolian example transposed to `Fmin7`. This creates a nice leading tone from the D# at the end that doesn't sound jarring. Plus, it sounds like it should lead somewhere. I think I am satisfied with this.
