Listening to _Separate Ways_ by Journey.

The melody is simple:
- It has a call-response that goes down and then up.
- The last phrase in the chorus is a little higher, but then later it's even higher

The chorus tends to not use so many words and remind us why we're here. Verses will expand on the story.

Homework: The vocalization in the break works as a chorus melody. Try putting words to it to make it into a chorus.
Bonus: Try to also write a prechorus.
