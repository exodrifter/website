I'm trying to figure out what kind of "event" Open Sauce would call itself. My impression is that it's a mix between a maker conference and science fair. It's an annual event and this year, it's taking place at San Mateo County Event Center from July 18-20. The first day was limited to "industry", so today was the first day it was open to the public.

[On the official website](https://opensauce.com/overview/), they don't really say much about what Open Sauce is:

> # A FESTIVAL OF MAKERS AND CREATORS
> 
> **Join Us at the 3rd Annual Open Sauce Live!**
>
> Get ready to experience three days of mad science experiments, new technology, and a full-on celebration of makers and creators.

They link to some articles about the event like [this 2024 article from tubefilter](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/25/open-sauce-2024-william-osman/) which calls Open Sauce a STEM convention for content creators, engineers, and fans of science.
