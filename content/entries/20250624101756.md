Double-checking the lyrics for _in the move_ now that it's done. Last time I wrote them down was in [20250422045817](20250422045817.md).

(verse)<br/>
hands tight, walk with me<br/>
see the forest for the trees<br/>
insight, you’ve got keys<br/>
make me feel like i’ve been seen<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>

(verse)<br/>
fingers laced, pull me close<br/>
in your taste what matters most<br/>
you’re so tender, it really hurts<br/>
need a mender, it’s what i chose<br/>

(pre-chorus)<br/>
you feel so good, i’m alive<br/>
you say those words, so sublime<br/>

i feel so good, it’s arrived<br/>
i said some words, i meant in kind<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>

(bridge)<br/>
lets plan another<br/>
don't wanna be a bother<br/>
say which whenever<br/>
i won't say never<br/>

lets plan another<br/>
don't wanna be a bother<br/>
say which whenever<br/>
i won't say never<br/>

lets plan another<br/>
don't wanna be a bother<br/>
say which whenever<br/>
i won't say never<br/>

lets plan another<br/>
don't wanna be a bother<br/>
say which whenever<br/>
i won't say never<br/>

(chorus)<br/>
but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>

but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>

but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>

but i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
i lost you in the move<br/>
in the move<br/>
