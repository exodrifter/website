I was starting to feel some hand strain while playing minecraft from holding down the left mouse button, so I was looking for some kind of setting that would let me toggle the left mouse button instead of needing to hold it down.

I didn't find a minecraft setting for it, but I did find this instead:

> Typing `xte "mousedown 1"` on a console seems to do what you're looking for. It simulated a click and hold of the first mouse button. The button appears to stay clicked until I click another mouse button.

I was able to find a reference to `xte` on the Arch Linux wiki as well, confirming that the `xte` tool is in the `xautomation` package:

> _xte_ from [xautomation](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=xautomation) comes handy when we want to bind keyboard buttons to mouse.

Using this information, I installed `xte` with `pacman -S xautomation` and then set a keybinding in my settings to run `xte "mousedown 1"` on a key combination, which let me hold the left mouse button down like I wanted to.
