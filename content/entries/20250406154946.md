Someone in a Discord server I'm in linked this video: [A First Look At Raytraced Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6EuAUjq92k) by Vercidium. I found the information in the video to be really unconvincing, feeling like they were spending an awful lot of compute on a result that wasn't very good. However, I lack the knowledge to know why.

So, I discussed this with a friend who studied sound propagation in graduate school. He pointed out that sound is a much lower frequency than light, so diffraction effects are much more pronounced. The video by Vercidium only uses specular reflections.

They sent me [one example](https://gamma.cs.unc.edu/GSOUND/) from 2011 made by Carl Schissler and Dinesh Manocha which has a [video recording](https://gamma.cs.unc.edu/GSOUND/video.mp4) which I find much more convincing.

For more information about sound propagation, I can read [other publications by Carl Schissler](http://www.carlschissler.com/index.php?page=publications) and read [the proprietary source code](https://github.com/GAMMA-UMD/pygsound).
