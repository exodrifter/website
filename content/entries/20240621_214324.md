- Looked into a potential single-pass solution for the `ViewportTexture`s not having mipmaps problem, but I didn't understand it and I accidentally caused a gfx ring timeout bug in the amdgpu driver, so I decided not to mess around with it more. I did find out though that linear filtering on the texture works better.
- Added a reactor startup sound to make pressing the reactor restart button feel more rewarding and less anticlimatic.
