Final nitpicks for _idea_:
- A click or some other sfx to indicate that the ambiance is being cut off
- The pluck over the strings in the ending needs to match the chords (or vice versa). One note in the chord could change (E to F, for example)

Royal road progression:
- A big part of this progression is to hover around the IV and V chords. For example, IV -> V -> iii -> vi
- Vadd4 has a heart-tug feeling
- The royal road progression is really good at bringing out emotion
- Never play the I chord, we could end on IV.
- We could play the I chord inversion, also known as a "Mu chord"
- If you're playing a minor chord, you step down to the next chord using minor chords a half-step away similar to gospel/jazz music.
- J-rock does, in part, take inspiration from gospel and fusion jazz.
