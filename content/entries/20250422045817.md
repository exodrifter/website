Changed the lyrics again for _in the move_. It's mostly the same as [20250420233952](20250420233952.md).

(verse)
hands tight, walk with me
see the forest for the trees
insight, you've got keys
make me feel like i've been seen

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move

(verse)
fingers laced, pull me close
in your taste what matters most
you're so tender, it really hurts
need a mender, it's what i chose

(pre-chorus)
you feel so good, i'm alive
you say those words, so sublime

i feel so good, it's arrived
i said some words, i meant in kind

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move

(bridge)
lets plan another
dont wanna be a bother
say which whenever
i wont say never

lets plan another
dont wanna be a bother
say which whenever
i wont say never

lets plan another
dont wanna be a bother
say which whenever
i wont say never

lets plan another
dont wanna be a bother
say which whenever
i wont say never

(chorus)
but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move

but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move

but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move

but i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
i lost you in the move
in the move
in the move
