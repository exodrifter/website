Learned about a version control system called Diversion: https://www.diversion.dev/

It boasts having very good UX, to the point of not requiring a user to learn how it works, with the following features:
- Work with large files out of the box
- Built-in file locking
- Continuous cloud sync
- Branching like in Git

It also plans on adding granular repository permissions which allow for contributions without sharing the entire repository or creating a new one

It seems neat. I get the impression that the two hazards for using it are:
- **enshittification** it looks like they are in the "aquire users by being really nice" phase of an enshittification cycle. I suspect this because they have a generous free tier (limited at 5 users and 100 gb of storage), they're backed by ycombinator, and it appears that you cannot self-host the server and your only option is their cloud server.
- **vendor lock-in** it doesn't appear to be implemented via a widely used vcs, so if you have technical problems with it you might find it more difficult to get assistance from others or if you want to migrate back off of it
