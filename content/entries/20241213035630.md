I was watching [JellyBearTV](https://www.twitch.tv/jellybeartv) stream on Twitch when I noticed them select a few clips in the playlist and then merge them together into one clip, which I didn't know was possible. Apparently the keyboard shortcut for it is `ctrl+g`. Looking into the context menu for the playlist, the same option is available under `Edit > Merge selected clips`.
