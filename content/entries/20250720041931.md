A few more notes about tables I saw today at Open Sauce Live, at least of the ones I picked up marketing material for (like flyers, business cards, etc), that aren't related to games:

- [Gems of Science](https://gemsofscience.com) - They sell gems that have been artificially synthesized.
- [Graphite](https://graphite.rs) - Free, open-source 2D raster/vector editor with a node-based procedural workflow by Graphite Labs, LLC. I've seen this before and I'm excited to see it get better.
- [Makera](https://www.makera.com) - Desktop CNC milling machines. It's really cool to see smaller scale CNC machines. These interest me, since it would give me the opportunity to "3D print" parts that are more sustainable.
