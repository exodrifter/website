Working on the lyrics:

> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> so i can remember how it went
> in my lonely love
> 
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> in my lonely love

Rearranged the lyrics so that the rhymes are closer together and changed the repeated fourth line to "in my lonely love" which i seem to have found a pleasing rhythm for.
