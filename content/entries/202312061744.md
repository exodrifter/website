Analyzing [Porter Robinson & Madeon - Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0)

It's in C, but it uses the IV chord a lot. This is because although it doesn't play a chord in or resolve to C, it has a B natural which is pervasive throughout. The fact that it never resolves to C adds to the feeling of yearning.

Like most electronic music, it has the same chorus and melody which doesn't change, but it develops by growing the ensemble and instrumentation. At the end, it takes away things like removing elements or adding silence where there wasn't any before. There are also parts like beats being replaced by drum fills.

Recommended I listen to VIRTUAL SELF by Porter Robinson.

Notes about the structure:
- Groove:
	- Call and Response structure
- Verse:
	- There's a riser that is growing in volume
	- It's using the same melody, but the chord progression is different and there is more instrumentation
	- There's a lower number of chords, which helps with the pacing

Homework: Work on a piece with lyrics.
