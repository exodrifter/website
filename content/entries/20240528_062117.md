Apparently, you can play Dharma Doujo on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/arcade_dharma) in your web browser, which is very cool.

archive.org runs the game using MAME, and the default controls are:
- `5` Insert credit for player 1
- `6` Insert credit for player 2
- `1` Start Game
- `P` Pause Game
- `Left Ctrl` Player Button 1
- `Arrow Keys` for joystick movement

MAME controls and options can be configured using `tab`.
