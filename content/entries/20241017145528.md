- [ ] ~~Add a setting to make up and down controls relative.~~ https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/0/4692279523718195819/ Movement is already relative, but we do want space and ctrl as alternate controls for them
- [x] Add space and shift as alternate controls to go up and down
- [x] Add note that the game auto-saves to pause menu
