Around 2025-07-24 00:00 UTC, I noticed that all adult games on itch.io had been delisted thanks to conversations on Discord and a sudden influx of activity in the official itch.io discord server. About an hour before this happened at 2025-07-23 23:19 UTC, Leaf posted just "ðŸ«¡" with no accompanying message in the `#news` channel of the official Discord server.

In the itch.io Discord server, I noticed users speculating that the delisting was happening because of the Collective Shout campaign, which had caused Steam to remove a lot of adult content from its platform just about a week earlier.

I decided to [post about this on t/suki](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/collective-shout-causes-game-platforms-to-change-adult-content-policy/415/12) around 2025-07-24 05:00 UTC. At this time, I noticed that only 48 results appeared on itch.io's website if you tried to filter by the adult tag.
