In Obsidian, it's very hard to show a subset of notes that are all related to each other when the notes you want to see cannot be organized neatly into one single folder.

You could add a new note which links to all of the notes, but this causes the following problems:

* Each note is now linked to the new note, increasing visual noise in the graph that is not useful.
* It is still not possible to type a query to show all of the related notes, since there is no way for Obsidian to know what depth to use when including linked notes.
* The new note often has something in common with the other notes, making it impossible to filter out just the new note.

A potential fix for this problem that I'm trying is to use tags as a way to filter the graph view. This does require me to add the tag to each post I want to include, but since you can hide tags even when you search on them, you can avoid the additional visual noise in the graph.
