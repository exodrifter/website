Looking up what the `br`, `-`, and `+` symbols are called in Synthesizer V. I found this in the official manual:

> https://synthesizerv.com/manual/entering_lyrics.htm
>
> **Syllable Break**
> Use plus sign to break down a multi-syllable word. In this example, the first note says "birth" and the following says "day".
>
> **Legato**
> Use minus sign to mark the continuation of the last sung vowel.

This in an unofficial manual:

> https://manual.synthv.info/quickstart/entering-lyrics/#adding-breaths
>
> Breath notes can be added by entering `br` as the note's lyric (AI singers only).

I also found these symbols on Dreamtonic's website under a section titled "Synthesizer V Studio
Phoneme Reference": https://dreamtonics.com/svstudio-resources/

Looks like people interchangeably use the terms "note" and "phoneme" for it, but I'll stick with "phoneme" since that's what the reference is called.
