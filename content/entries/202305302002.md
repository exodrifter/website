I've noticed that Obsidian Sync does not show moved files with their original creation date. Instead, the creation date on synced computers is changed to when you renamed or moved the file. It also "forgets" the history of the file, since it treats a move as a delete followed by creating an entirely new file with the same exact contents. On the local machine where you made the change, the creation date will still be correct.

This does not happen in a vault without Obsidian Sync.
