First day showing _no signal_ at GodotCon Boston 2025:
- 27 plays, 1 finish
- interacting with the tape player crashes the game?
- Player suggested to add a setting to control the smoothing (or turn it off)
- Player suggested disabling look while using WASD to move
- Add gyro controls?
- Can't navigate easily horizontally for xyz in settings
- Touch inputs can spin camera when changing mouse position
- Can I detect wayland automatically? i should turn off mouse wrap by default on Wayland.
