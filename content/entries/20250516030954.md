Apparently, some in the discussion group for UFO 50 seem to think that most people play the games in sequential order while some of us think that most people would play the games in random, potentially based on title and cover art.

We discussed how there might be selection bias in our perception of how others play the game, for example how one person noted that posts on the UFO 50 subreddit seem to suggest that players tend to play sequentially.

Other related questions the group posed:
- Could anything be said about the players who play sequentially or at random?
- What if we recorded what order you play the games in, and which one was your favorite? Does the order you play things in change which one ends up as your favorite? Or are you more likely to find what your favorite game is by picking at random?
