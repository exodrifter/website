I'm transcribing a recipe from my physical notebook dated 7/16/2020. Looking at the ingredients, it seems likely that I originally got this recipe from [veganheaven.org](https://veganheaven.org/recipe/vegan-cornbread/).

# Cornbread

1 1/4 c cornmeal
1 c flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 c brown sugar

1/4 c vegan butter
1c soymilk
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

stir, don't overmix,
add 1c corn kernels
preheat oven to 400F
bake in 8-9 inch dish (grease w/ butter!)
for 20-25 minutes

# 7/16/2020

subbed baking soda for baking powder
and jalapenos for corn kernels
accidentally forgot to mix dry ingredients
first, lined pan with parchment instead
of butter.

bread seperated cleanly, but it took
an additional 20 min to cook. I think
it was too thick; use more pans

# 8/1/2020
added drained 15oz corn and \[unreadable]
jalapenos to doubled recipe.
lined just the bottom of three pans

bread seperated cleanly, almost completely
cooked at 30 min. Good amount of
corn.
