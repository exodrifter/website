Trying to practice some lyric writing:

all i want is a second chance
you make me see me
a second chance
so i can show you you

another late night
light headed exhaustion
it was worth it
but i am still curled up in bed awake

it was normal at first
now i can't stop
how could this happen
will you still be around
