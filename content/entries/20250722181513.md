Someone shared this file-sharing program [Blip](https://blip.net/) in a Discord server I'm in.

It's an application you can download to securely send any file of any size from one computer to another, with the ability to resume download progress if the download is interrupted for any reason.

It's only free for noncommercial use, and it appears to be a proprietary program. It's billed at $300/user/year otherwise.

It reminds of [JustBeamIt](https://justbeamit.com/) which is free, but proprietary and it's unclear whether or not files are transferred securely. They say that files are streamed through their servers, but that they don't record any file contents.
