Playing through _no signal_ on the Steam Deck:
- [ ] Using D Pad to change selection in item popups also moves camera
- [ ] Card underneath activity mat is too dark, maybe just make it unlit
- [ ] Sea creature collection spot popup does not grab focus
- [ ] 3D printer popup does not grab focus
- [ ] Workshop Printer does not grab focus
- [ ] No sound for picking up charm
- [ ] OSD keyboard doesn't pop up automatically on text line edits
- [ ] Can't scroll thrust curve simulator
- [ ] Probe popup does not grab focus
- [ ] Probe launch laptop does not grab focus
- [ ] Cannot use d-pad in probe launch laptop
- [ ] Can't open doors in real scenes

I got stuck at this point, since I couldn't open the door.
