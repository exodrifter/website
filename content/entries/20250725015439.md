Someone in my Discord community helped me find the dates for past Open Sauce events:

- 2023: July 14-16
	- The event is named "Open Sauce 2023"
	- Homepage shows July 15-16 https://web.archive.org/web/20230705233729/https://opensauce.live/
	- Ticketing page shows July 14th at 5PM for a "Friday Night Featured Creator Party" https://web.archive.org/web/20230709105743/https://opensauce.live/tickets/
	- This [tubefilter article](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/25/open-sauce-2024-william-osman/) mentions that 2024 was the second year of Open Sauce, so this must be the first year it was held.
	- [opensauce.live](https://opensauce.live) currently redirects to [opensauce.com](https://opensauce.com), so I think this link is legitimate.
- 2024: June 14-16
	- The event is named "Open Sauce 2024"
	- Homepage shows June 14-16 https://web.archive.org/web/20240616132104/https://opensauce.com/#expand
	- June 14th is labeled as "Industry day" https://web.archive.org/web/20240615172117/https://opensauce.com/industry-day/
- 2025: July 18-20
	- The event is named "Open Sauce 2025"
	- Homepage shows July 18-20 https://web.archive.org/web/20250603000011/https://opensauce.com/
	- July 18th is labeled as "Industry day" https://web.archive.org/web/20250602235832/https://opensauce.com/tickets/
	- I already have these dates, since I went to the event, but I might as well store the archive.org link here too.
- 2026: July 17-19
	- The event is named "Open Sauce 2026"
	- This is the information on https://opensauce.com/ right now
	- They're selling tickets for General Admission, which is only for the 18th-19th, so I'm guessing July 17th will be industry day again.
