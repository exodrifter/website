- Show controls and reset view button before lights are turned on.
- Auto-select next drive bay when inserting a drive, or auto-close prompt.
- Color coordinate drives and computers
- I could break the cassette tapes sometimes, which means you need to manually re-wind the tape back into the cassette.
- Add z and c to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise?
- The play button on cassette players isn't supposed to be red
- Show item collection counts in inventory
- Position popup dialogs in center of screen instead of position of item
