Working on implementing the remaining feedback from the _lost contact_ showcase at ATX GameMakers 3rd Annual Showcase and Arcade event from last week.

Thinking about how to implement wall transparency in _lost contact_, but it runs into a few problems. We would want to implement wall transparency by changing the shader that the brush script uses and then map that to a palette value, but this is not currently possible in the existing system. The following refactors would need to take place:

- Change brush to ask for what shader to use
- Change brush to introspect shader to decide what properties to show in the inspector
- Change brush to look up swatches by shader
- Change palette to communicate swatch changes to dependent brushes
