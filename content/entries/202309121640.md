During my music lesson, we're talking about chords that can highlight a certain mode.

Ionian - Cmaj7, C6
Dorian - Dmin#6, Dmin#13
Phrygian - Emin flat 9, Fmaj7/E (with the 7th in the bass)
Lydian - Fmaj7#11, F6#11
Mixolydian - G7, G9, G7add4
Aeolian - Amin7, Amin9, Amin11
Locrian - B half diminished

Slash chords indicate which notes to play in the bass

Cmaj7 -> CEGB
Cmaj7/G -> GCEGB or GCEB
Cmaj7/D -> DCEGB

If the base chord has the same note, you might omit it from the base chord.

Homework: Write one chord progression using two chords from the list.
