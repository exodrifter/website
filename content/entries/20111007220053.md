While migrating my Tumblr posts from my data request, I noticed that I had a draft for a post that I never published.

The URL for the post would have been https://dpek.tumblr.com/post/11154070550 and is dated 2011-10-07 22:00:53 GMT.

I've included the contents of the draft below.

# Customization in MMORPGs

Please note that in this post, I will refer to free to play MMORPGs as MMOs.

Whenever I play an MMO, I want to be able to play as another person. I mean, it's supposed to be a role playing game with the added element that I'm interacting with many people over the internet. But many times, I find that many MMOs that I play fall short of my expectations. Many times, instead of offering expansive customization options (like [Gaia Online](http://www.gaiaonline.com/) does, for instance) I instead find an offering of an expansive new world to explore where the character you play as well as everyone else are forced to wear the same armor or use the same characters. Or instead, there are a few customization options available to the player, but they charge extra for this service (such as in the case of Spiral Knights). In other cases, such as the case for Mabinogi, there are many customization options, but they are all much too difficult to obtain.
