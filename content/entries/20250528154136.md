Music lesson:
- Talking about _petrichor slices_
	- I tried to add a bass line
- Suggested using less notes for the bass.
	- Bassline sound more like punk rock because it's on the downbeat, we want it to sound more like funk.
	- We can add some off-beat notes to make is sound less like it's on the downbeat. We want to add syncopation.
	- This changes the bassline from a supportive role to an active participant role.
	- Try to remove as many notes as possible while still keeping a good experience for the listener
- Listening to an example of a good syncopated bass line:
	- [Snarky Puppy - Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdgwlZ5__c&pp=ygUYc25hcmt5IHB1cHB5IGZsb29kIG11c2lj)
- Try changing up the bass line the second time it happens by going up an octave sometimes.
