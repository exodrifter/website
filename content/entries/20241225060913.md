I tried using B612 on my website, but despite liking how it looks I found a few issues with it that I dislike quite a bit:

- By default, the `0` and `O` characters are not easily differentiable (See [polarsys/b612#20](https://github.com/polarsys/b612/issues/20))
- The `.` has a kerning which aligns it to the left instead of centering it between glyphs, causing version numbers to look odd
- The `[` and `(` characters look similar (See [polarsys/b612#25](https://github.com/polarsys/b612/issues/25))
- The `:` and `;` characters look similar and are very small
- The `` ` `` and `'` characters look similar

This seems ironic considering their claim to legibility, but these problems might have only arisen due to the fact that I will be using this font a lot in the context where code is being written about, where mistakes that confuse these characters would be rather problematic. In addition, the last time the repository for the font was updated was 5 years ago.

It's probably better that I don't use this font for my website.
