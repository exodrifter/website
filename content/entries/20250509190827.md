Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250503221149](20250503221149.md), [20250506132816](20250506132816.md), and [20250507125107](20250507125107.md)

Tanuki:
- [ ] Make Naoko's charm model
- [ ] Switch velcro mats to something more "traditional"?
- [ ] Bobby-fy `meeting-a plan`
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in medical room
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in workshop

TODO:
- [ ] Add poem song puzzle to music room
- [ ] Add breathing sounds in part 3
- [ ] Lighting doesn't load properly sometimes again (inconsistent)
- [ ] Don't move camera when changing selection in popup menus using the D-Pad
- [x] ~~interacting with the tape player crashes the game?~~ trying to look at the broken drive right after looking at any other item crashes the game with a SIGSEGV
- [x] Player suggested to add a setting to control the smoothing (or turn it off)
- [x] Player suggested disabling look while using WASD to move
- [ ] ~~Add gyro controls?~~ This would be really nice, but I need to cut this for time reasons
- [x] Can't navigate easily horizontally for xyz in settings
- [ ] ~~Touch inputs can spin camera when changing mouse position~~ Found out that this is because the Steam deck is running Wayland and switching the mouse wrap mode to disabled fixes the problem.
- [x] Can I detect wayland automatically? i should turn off mouse wrap by default on Wayland.
- [ ] Can't use touchscreen when steam deck is in controller input mode in desktop mode
- [ ] ~~Up and down aren't global~~ I don't like the way this feels because your ability to move the camera is reduced based on the camera's pitch. Keeping it local also matches the behavior of Godot.
- [ ] Analog stick moves puzzle selection too quickly
- [ ] Cannot play tapes with controller
- [x] forward/back controls move chat log even when chat log isnt focused
- [x] item highlight doesn't go away when you focus on a screen
