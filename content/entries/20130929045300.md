This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Spacekill is a game about killing people in space. I made this game at EGaDS Game Jam 2013 in under 24 hours while also simultaneously hosting the event.

I created everything in the game except for the music, game over sound, and the font. The credit for those sounds go to [Orbitron](http://freesound.org/people/sangardo/sounds/157363/]sangrado[/url] and [url=http://freesound.org/people/edithouse/sounds/159561/]edithouse[/url] on Freesound.org. The font I used is [url=https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron), from the League of Movable Type.

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished in September 2013.
