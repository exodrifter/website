Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250601023754](20250601023754.md)
- Notes on Steam Cloud Sync: [20250601101123](20250601101123.md) ,[20250601101803](20250601101803.md)
- v0.35.6 was made just to test cloud sync and joypad issues
- v0.35.7 includes the level design changes
- That's it... the game is finally done. The only things left are QA, playtesting, and marketing.

Joystick:
- [ ] ~~Can't use touchscreen when steam deck is in controller input mode in desktop mode~~ Can't replicate this anymore, I guess my input refactors have fixed this issue as a side effect or maybe the Steam deck had a bug that was fixed by Valve.
- [ ] ~~Missing hover sound when in fps mode and hovering over door~~ Because of the way the controls are set up, adding this is quite difficult and complicated. I think I'd rather drop the hover sound, because I feel like its contribution to the experience of the game is questionable.
- [x] Remove hover sound
- [x] ~~Can't switch easily between mouse and controller~~ This only happens on the title screen now
- [x] Can't scroll using controller on credits screen
- [ ] ~~Can't cancel out of menus on title and pause with b button~~ This was because Steam Input was set up to use Keyboard/Mouse inputs. Updating the Steam Input setting fixed the problem
- [x] Can't scroll save list with controller when it is too long
- [x] Adding a new game doesn't scroll list to bottom
- [x] Can't look using right joystick in real scenes

Misc:
- [x] Test cloud save

Level design:
- [x] Add decals on activity room cork board pages
	- [x] maybe add more information about how poltergeist works
- [x] Add decals on workshop cork board pages
	- [x] maybe add information about replacement printer parts, like the printer head
- [x] Add painting to 2G
- [x] Label painting items in 2G
