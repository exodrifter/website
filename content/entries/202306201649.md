A **Half cadence** is a partial resolution, mostly used in classical music.

`IV -> V7`
`F -> G7`

Usually, they are used in the following eight measure pattern:
`1 2 3 Half 5 6 7 Full`

You can think of half cadences like commas (`,`) and full cadences like periods (`.`). Half cadences exist because of the assertion in classical western music that cadences cannot cross between bar lines.

However, you can also think of it as just being a full cadence since it ends on a full cadence.
