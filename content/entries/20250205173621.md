Talking about my music homework:
- Switching out the drums to something more beefy was a good choice, but if I want to go back to this section I will probably want to keep the new drums.
- Guitar sounds like it's part of the chorus.
- Pacing is good so far.
- If I want to add lyrics, I can do a band introduction. Instead of adding an extra measure after the build-up, repeat without the lead and with the instrumentation while adding vocals.
- Could consider doing call response with the guitar and lyrics, sync up on the last pattern.
- We're on track to having 3-chorus song, which is a song that has the chorus repeat three times. For example: intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus. This is how most early 2000s pop songs are structured.
- You normally don't want to play the chorus more than three times. But Vulfpeck is a funk group known for having choruses that are catchy enough that they can play them over and over again. For example, [VULFPECK // Big Dipper & Matter of Time (From Clarity of Cal)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEah75Oyv8c)
