More notes on _no signal_ streams that I've watched recently:
- Grandbuh (2) 2025-08-21 23:29 UTC
- Outfrost (2) 2025-08-20 22:09 UTC
- ZenTractor (3) 2025-08-23 10:00 UTC
	- Didn't like that the hints were often redundant due to being a more thorough player, but was happy the hints were there. Liked the game overall.

- I tried to watch SpeedTixi's VOD from 2025-08-20 12:37 UTC, but this was in French and while I'm trying to learn, I don't know much yet so I couldn't understand what they were saying. They only played for about an hour and didn't finish the demo portion of the game.

Times are from SullyGnome.
