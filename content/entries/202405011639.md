Talking about G Major and E Minor. Scales have relative minor and majors, which have the same notes but have the opposite scale quality.

Reviewing my chord resolution homework.
- Resolving leading tones as the top notes tend to sound more like they resolve. If the top note doesn't change, then it does not sound like it resolves.
- Flat 2 cadence can be used sparingly to enhance endings or transitions.

**Chromatic Mediance** is the movement of thirds in chord progressions, which may not be in the key that you are in.

Homework: Write a 4 or 8 chord progression using one of the chord resolutions from my last homework.
