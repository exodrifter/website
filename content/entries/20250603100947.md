Trying to figure out why virtual keyboards don't appear automatically on Steam Deck. Unfortunately, it appears that Godot does not implement this:

At least I assume that is what the game you mentioned does, but as I have never seen it, I can't be entirely sure.

Sure enough, if you try to see how it is implemented, you find out that the text edit calls the abstract function `DisplayServer.virtual_keyboard_show`. [Searching for all implementations of this function, it's only implemented for iOS and Android.](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agodotengine%2Fgodot+virtual_keyboard_show&type=code&p=1)
