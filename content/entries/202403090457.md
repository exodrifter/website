Tips from [JellyBearTV](https://www.twitch.tv/JellyBearTV) on how to use Solaria:
- Using volume knobs in synthv seems to cause the audio to clip, so turning it down below 0 db seems to help.
- Use light preset on verse and solid for chorus, the presets change how shouty or quiet Solaria will be.
- You can use the pencil tool to edit the pitch
- Use `-` to keep the tone going on another note, this lets you glide between pitches
- You can use `br` at the end of notes
- Recommends not connecting `br` to the first note when used at the beginning
- You can get SynthV resources from here: https://resource.dreamtonics.com/download/
- Get Solaria to sing one note, turn up the breathiness, and use Charsiesis to do scream vocals.
- Harmonies is important with vocal synths, so layer additional vocals at different pitches like a 5th down and pan them. It adds to the humanization element; it sounds like backing vocals.
- Using SynthV with vocoding can make it sound more human
