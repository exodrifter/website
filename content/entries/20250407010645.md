**Megan Leavey (2017)** is an American autobiographical war film about Megan Leavey and her bomb-sniffing dox Rex. I thought the film was okay, but I was a bit surprised at how light the film was on content. I didn't feel like I got a good understanding of the volume of work Megan and Rex did and the emotional content of the film, while done respectfully, lacked impact.

Unsurprisingly, the film doesn't really examine the context of the war they participate in and the circumstances leading to Megan joining the military. It makes sense that they don't, but without such critical analysis it leaves me with the feeling that the film is propaganda as it falls in line with the kind of recruitment ads you normally see for the military.
