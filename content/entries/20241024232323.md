Ran into an error in gitea while uploading releases, which reads:

> You can not upload any more files.

Apparently, Gitea has a default limit of 5 attachments for releases. I ran into this limit because I wanted to upload the full build and demo build for three different platforms and a save file.

You can change this by changing the value for the `MAX_FILES` setting in the config under `repository.upload`:

```
[repository.upload]
; Max number of files per upload. Defaults to 5
MAX_FILES = 5
```
