I tried to get as many permanent certificates as I could in _Great Western Trail: New Zealand_, but this strategy didn't really work out for me. I quickly got +4 certificates, one from the start by paying 4 money, one from placing offices with the ship action, one from unlocking the second permanent certificate from a black border delivery, and one from a B tile.

However, as I found out, deliveries do not generate very much money. I spent most of my turns failing to acquire employees, failing to build buildings, and failing to get better cows due to not having enough money. Having a +4 benefit doesnt really help that much when the improved delivery doesn't award you much and doesn't help you build your engine.

In this game, I scored last with 72 points, roughly 30 points behind first and second who scored 108 and 98.
