_no signal_ stream 169:
- Copied TODOs from [20250127184748](20250127184748.md)
- It would have been nice if the assets were set up to have collision shapes on different layers (one for raycasting and another for movement collision, for example)

- [ ] Break door leading to common area
- [ ] Add Ring EVA Room
- [ ] Update level mapping to include new real levels
- [ ] Add footstep sounds
- [ ] Add breathing sounds

Unsure:
- [ ] ~~[#15](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/15) Add OCR for handwritten notes~~
- [ ] ~~Maybe we should color coordinate drives and computers? I didn't like it when I did this before, but maybe I could approach the problem in a different way... Also, the colors would mostly be useful for people who don't read but I'm designing a game that depends a lot on reading.~~ In playtesting, people seem to generally be able to figure things out.
- [ ] ~~Auto-select first empty slot when clicking on drive bays~~ In playtesting, people generally figure out what to click on and when I tried to implement this before, I felt that it made it too easy to click on the drive bay.
- [ ] ~~Show button on screen when camera is in stair or door region~~ Playtesters click on the stairs now with the addition of the gradient to make it darker at the bottom.
