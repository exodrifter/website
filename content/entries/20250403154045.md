Music lesson:
- Talking about the lyrics I wrote [20250325054941](20250325054941.md)
- I don't know how to turn the lyrics into a song
- Try singing the lyrics with chords
- In Too Hot in L.A., the rhyming scheme in the opening verses are ABCB then ABAB
- It's easier to not rhyme on the third stanza (I mean, you're talking about the apocalypse) because you'll rhyme on the fourth.
- "typesetting" is taking existing lyrics and putting them into music
