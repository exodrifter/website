Showing _no signal_ at MAGWest. Today is Friday (Day 1):
- Plays: 15
- Setup was 9-12, Open from 12-20. I arrived around 10.
- Feels a bit different to show the game now that it is out
- Indie game tables were in the same room as the arcade. nice!
- Did a small highlight video with head of media at MAGWest (?) before the floor opened
- The floor was opened a bit early (about 10-15m) because people were queueing for the arcade room, causing a potential fire hazard in the hallway
