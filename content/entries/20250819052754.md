I watched the first episode of CITY THE ANIMATION today with a friend. It's animated by 京都アニメーション (Kyoto Animation) [^1], who are also known as 京アニ (KyoAni). [^2] I've been interested in this as CITY was written by あらゐけいいち (Keiichi Arawi), who made another favorite anime of mine, 日常 (Nichijou). [^3]

I really loved how vibrant and unique this anime is, especially considering the other animes I've seen that have been released recently. The music and animation are very distinct and are very good at conveying the moment. The music has a lot of variation in it as well, and I can tell that there are quite a few different musical influences.

It feels like a less hectic version of Nichijou, though still absurdly funny at some points. The comedic timing of the fried noodle scene, both in animation (slow shot of the plate followed by a very quick animation of the noodles) and sound (a rise in the music suddenly cut off by the apology), was done really well.

I love this anime so far and it's easily a favorite, at least based on the first episode.
