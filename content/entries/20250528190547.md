I'm working on testing Steam achievements for _no signal_, but I need to figure out how to reset them. I found [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928878449), which I've summarized the steps of below:

1. Run `steam://open/console` in a web browser.
2. In the new Console tab in the Steam client...
	1. Reset one achievement: `achievement_clear <application ID> <achievement name>`
	2. Reset all achievements: `reset_all_stats <application ID>`

So for _no signal_, to reset all achievements I would run:

```
reset_all_stats 2840590
```

Or, for each individual achievement, I would run:

```
achievement_clear 2840590 LIGHTS
achievement_clear 2840590 REACTOR
achievement_clear 2840590 DUTCHMAN_STATION
achievement_clear 2840590 PROBE_SENT
achievement_clear 2840590 SIGNAL_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 VOICES_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 WORDS_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 TAPES_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 EGGBUG
achievement_clear 2840590 CHESS_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 FISHES_FOUND
achievement_clear 2840590 GOOD_LUCK_CHARM
```
