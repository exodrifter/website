The following note is from my "hobby" Obsidian vault that I never dated. The last modified timestamp according to the file system is `2023-08-06T22:12:42-0700` and the created timestamp is `2023-10-15 12:05:30-0700`, but this is on a computer the file was synced to. So, I don't know when this note was made.

It did link to other dated entries, which I've gone ahead and linked in this note.

# Dry-wet Ribs

An old ribs recipe I used to make, which took inspiration from Memphis-Style BBQ and St. Louisâ€“Style BBQ. It uses both a dry rub and a wet rub.

* Cover ribs with Memphis Dry Rub
* Cover ribs with aluminum foil (no need to wrap)
* Cook at ???F
* Brush BBQ sauce ontop
* Cook at ???F
* Broil to caramelize sauce ontop
