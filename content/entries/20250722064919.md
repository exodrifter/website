I realized I don't have a note for Summer Game Fest yet, so I'm looking for official information about the event. On their [homepage](https://www.summergamefest.com/), they state:

> Launched in May of 2020, Summer Game Fest unites the entire video game industry for a summer celebration, featuring digital events, demos, announcements, and breaking news for video game fans.

This year it took place at YouTube Theater in Los Angeles. I'm not sure if that's where it's always taken place. I can't find any more information about the event, but it appears to take place annually.
