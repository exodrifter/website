Fixed a problem where pathfinding didn't work after the character teleported by asking the navigation agent to generate a new path after teleportation.

```gdscript
func teleport(door: Door) -> void:
	# ...

	# Try repathing after teleporting
	navigation_agent.target_position = target.global_position
```

I'm not really sure why it fails after teleportation, but it makes sense that generally speaking a new path needs to be generated after the position of the character is changed. This might be happening because the `NavigationLink2D`s are too far away from the teleportation zone, so the navigation system doesn't realize that the teleportation has happened and it doesn't check the last waypoint in the navigation path as reached.
