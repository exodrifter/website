This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Fishkebab is a gameplay mechanics experiment that I made in the summer of 2013.

The point of the game is to try to harpoon the greatest number of fish. Since there is a lack of explanation for the controls: Press space to switch into harpoon mode and click to harpoon the fish.

It was written in Java using the libGDX library and was finished in the Fall of 2013.
