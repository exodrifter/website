I watched a movie called _The Wild Robot_ (2024) which is about a robot who finds purpose in raising a baby goose named Brightbill and getting him ready in time for the winter migration. I found the movie to be really good; it was emotional, I cried a little, and it was really touching. It also uses humor at the right times to keep some levity and release tension.

One of the quotes from the movie that really stood out to me was when the fox responds to Roz's question about how he was able to tell a story about love despite claiming to not know anything about it by saying "Yeah, well, when you grow up without something, you spend a lot of time thinking about it.". I can relate to this a lot.

I really liked how the story tells many different stories at the same time. It is on its surface a story about motherhood, but is also one about purpose, self-discovery, growth, and community.
