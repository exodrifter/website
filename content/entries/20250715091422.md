The following note is from my "hobby" Obsidian vault that I never dated. The last modified timestamp according to the file system is `2023-08-06T22:12:42-0700` and the created timestamp is `2023-10-15 12:05:30-0700`, but this is on a computer the file was synced to. So, I don't know when this note was made.

It did link to other dated entries, which I've gone ahead and linked in this note.
