Before last weekend's _Fantastic Arcade: Fun Size Edition!_ on October 26th, 2024 at the Baker Center, Fantastic Arcade was last held before the COVID-19 pandemic on November 16th, 2019 as _Fantastic Arcade Retro(spective)_ at the Museum of Human Achievement. [^1] [^2]

_Fantastic Arcade Retro(spective)_ is described as:

> Fantastic Arcade is a yearly celebration of indie and cult video games. For EAST this year weâ€™ll be looking back on the last 10 years of commissioned and showcased games. To do this we've asked 22 artists to create a new environment, visual compliment or conceptual home to each custom arcade cabinet.
