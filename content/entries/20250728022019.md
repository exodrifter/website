Ever since launch, there has been at least one person playing *no signal*. Today, while looking at the [SteamDB charts page for no signal](https://steamdb.info/app/2840590/charts/), I noticed that there was only one player playing the game. However, when I refreshed the page a few minutes later, there were zero players, which finally ended the streak.

The graph covers the time period from release at 2025-07-25 21:00 UTC to 2025-07-28 02:00 UTC.

Over every hour, for the last week, https://steamdb.info/api/GetGraphWeek/?appid=2840590 returns:

```
