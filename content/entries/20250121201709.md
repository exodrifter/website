Trying to experiment with the Bandcamp Listening Parties feature. Unfortunately, it appears that Bandcamp won't inform anyone that a listening party is scheduled until you publicly publish your album. However, once you publish your album all of the music becomes available right away (and for purchase and download, if that is enabled).

It seems like the _only_ way right now to have a listening party without also releasing all of the tracks at the same time is to set up a pre-order. However, pre-orders require the album to be priced instead of pay-what-you-want.
