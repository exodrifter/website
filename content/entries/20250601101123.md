Trying to figure out how to test Steam Cloud. I found the following in the documentation:

> If you are adding Steam Auto-Cloud to a game which has already been released and you have enabled developer-only mode during the [Initial Setup](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud#initial-setup) then you must complete some additional steps to test the functionality.  
>
> 1. Sign in to Steam with an account that owns the app that you are testing.  
> 2. Open the Steam Console by navigating to `steam://open/console` in your browser.  
> 3. Enter `testappcloudpaths <AppId>` into the console with the given App ID that you are testing. Ex: `testappcloudpaths 480`  
> 4. Enter `set_spew_level 4 4` into the console.  
> 5. Launch your app from Steam.

I already have developer-only mode disabled, so all I need to do to verify that the auto cloud saves are working, aside from testing, is to run `set_spew_level 4 4`. This lets me see a log that looks something like this, when the game closes:

```

Looks like it's working!
