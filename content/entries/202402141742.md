Reviewing Chorus 2:
> i don't know how you say we will never change
> don't know when you'll stay but things were always strange
> i tried to fix my ways
> but things remain the same

Comments:
- This chorus has a nice rhythm and is very active
- To reduce how active it is, listen for moments that are busy and find another option that does the same thing

For example, we could remove "will" to make this lyric less active:
> i don't know how you say we ~~will~~ never change

Could use one of the chorus variations as a bridge, like how a pre-chorus introduces a chorus while bridges take us to a different place. Bridges are normally not repeated and acts as a contrast.

If the pre-chorus goes F Major to G Major, the bridge can go from E minor to D minor. If the piece is in A minor, you want to use whatever feels different from our pre-chorus and our tonic. It needs to sound different and new. Trying to write another pre-chorus can lead to a functional bridge.

Bridges are also a good opportunity to have instrumentals and taking away the lyrics. Don't let bridges outshine the chorus.

Homework: Try to find bridges in music I like or look them up. Finish putting the lyrics back into a full song.
