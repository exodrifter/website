I've gotten back home after my first day at Open Sauce, and I wanted to write a few notes about what I saw today, at least of the ones I picked up marketing material for (like flyers, business cards, etc).

In particular, this is the first year that Open Sauce has an "Indie Game Development Zone", so I saw a lot of games today and met a few people that I've seen at previous events.
