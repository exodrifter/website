Listening to Toxic by Britney Spears.

- Verse is lower in pitch and punctuated
- Pre-chorus is higher in pitch and airy
- Measure between the pre-chorus and chorus build tension
- chorus has a mix of punctuated and airy from the verse and pre-chorus respectively
- The vocals are made by layering regular vocals and whispering vocals over each other
- Pop music typically uses multiple voices ontop of each other, because just one vocal track doesn't have the same impact when in a complete mix.

Mark Ronson is a good composer behind many pop hits, should consider looking at some behind the scenes commentary.

Homework:
- Try to build out the track more and keep the impact I want for all of the phrases. Build out to the end of the first chorus.
