I'm trying to remember again how to print out the time a file was first added to a git repository, so I can add created dates to files that are missing created dates. I know I've searched for this before, and I find [this stack overflow answer again](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2390199/finding-the-date-time-a-file-was-first-added-to-a-git-repository).

> `git log --follow --format=%ad --date default <FILE> | tail -1`

> The option `%ad` shows the date in the format specified by the --date setting, one of `relative`, `local`, `iso`, `iso-strict`, `rfc`, `short`, `raw`, `human`, `unix`, `format:<strftime-string>`, `default`.

Using it, I construct the following command:

```sh
git log --follow --format=%ad --date format:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z "content/albums/index.md" | tail -1
```

This gives me the full ISO 8601 timestamp format with the date, time, and timezone offset. However, I notice after testing this that it's the same as the `iso-strict` setting.
