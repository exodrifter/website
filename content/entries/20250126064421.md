Trying to figure out why audio share in Discord on Linux doesn't work when screen sharing either an application or screen. After trying out a few things, it appears that Discord uses the PulseAudio API to capture audio. Switching the applications I want to capture from ALSA to PulseAudio appears to fix the problem.
