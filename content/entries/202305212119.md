Not sure what to do next. Here are some options after revisiting the list from [202305122210](202305122210.md) and thinking about other things I could do in a rough order of most important to least important:

* Bugfixing:
  * Fix the weird camera bounds bug
* Exploration:
  * Adding more dialog to the game
  * Adding more fetch quests
* World building:
  * Connect maps and add more maps
  * Add navigation to NPCs
* Key Narrative Sequences:
  * Contract signing sequence (missing code)
* Game UI:
  * Main Menu
  * Pause Menu
  * Credits
* Polish:
  * Add character portraits to dialog system
  * Implement a card minigame

I would like to talk to Evan about connecting and building out more of the map. So, I think for now I will just take lots of progress gifs to share.
