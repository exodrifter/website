I ran into a conversation on Discord recently where someone was unaware of the "Displayed Text" properties for `RichTextLabel` and `Label`, so I wanted to make a note about that.

`visible_characters` and `visible_ratio` allow you to define how much of the text you would like to show, allowing you to do animations that make the text appear like it is being typed out. `visible_characters` allows you to do this by defining how many characters to show while `visible_ratio` allows you to do this by defining a percentage (between the value of `0.0` and `1.0`)

`visible_characters_behavior` lets you define how those characters appear onto the screen. `VC_CHARS_BEFORE_SHAPING` looks exactly like text being typed by a user onto the screen, while `VC_CHARS_AFTER_SHAPING` shows the text where it would be after all the text is typed, preventing the visual flicker when text is added to the end of a line before jumping to the next line due to reaching the maximum length of the line.

I'm not sure what the other values for `visible_characters_behaviour` does exactly, though I imagine you'll have to use them if you are integrating support for RTL languages.
