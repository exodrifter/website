You can comment out parts of a document by surrounding the text to comment out with `%%`. For example:

```markdown
This sentence is missing a %%word%% in read mode.

%%
This only appears in edit mode.
%%
```

This appears as:

> This sentence is missing a %%word%% in read mode.
> 
> %%
> This only appears in edit mode.
> %%
