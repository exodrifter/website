Helping a friend learn how to make a world for ChilloutVR.

The [documentation](https://developers.abinteractive.net/cck/setup/) is pretty sparse, so we weren't sure what to do after setting up the package. I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OatATrRSO2A) which shows how to create a new world for ChilloutVR.

First of all, the CCK control panel is found under the `Alpha Blend Interactive` menu option in the title bar. In order to upload a scene, you need to log in using your username and the Content Creation Kit Master Key.

Then, you need to do the following in a scene you want to upload:
1. Add a new `GameObject`
2. Add the `CVRWorld` component to it
3. Open the CCK control panel and click the upload button

We found that it wasn't possible to test the world in the editor right away (though I'm guessing we could work around that by adding a basic first-person controller to the scene), but adding just the `CVRWorld` component was enough to make it possible to open the world in CCK and walk around in it.
