Talking about _the creek next to my home_ in my music lesson:
- Add a bass kick sound that has texture to help it mix with the rest of the track
- The drum timing is off. I should use use the "beat" instead of "step" for quantization when placing notes in the piano roll. The drums currently use 1/4 step, which results in a hard to understand rhythm. I should use 1/3 or 1/6 beat.
- To make a bass part, a way to start is to duplicate the kick notes into the bass. When the kick and bass are lined up, funk and fusion call this "locking in". Could add variety by introducing octaves between the notes or by playing notes longer
- Layer the bass part with a simple sine wave as a sub.
- Could transition into hits for the next part
- After the hits, I could do a longer build during the bridge that builds tension, don't play on the downbeat
- Could replace the piano with lyrics in some sections, do a call response with the piano and the lyrics
- For the hits, hits are usually a dotted eighth and a sixteenth. Could play this with a simplified version of the melody. The hits could be considered a chorus.
