Testing the demo build and found _more_ things that Godot does not export:
- The default bus specified in `audio/buses/default_bus_layout`
- `FileAccess` does not work for `res://` paths, but `ResourceLoader` does. I'm guessing this is because when the game is built, the game resources are now in the `.pck` file and there is no longer a file system to navigate.
