Music lesson, going over my cover of Something Comforting by Porter Robinson.

The drop has a bass and a few different synth pads layered ontop of each other. Use Vital or a Wavetable synth. It gives you full control over envelopes and LFOs.

- Add some release and attack to remove the click.
- Take out lows and mids, and keep just the highs for texture. You don't really want the main tone of the saw.
- Add another mid-synth and also add a highpass no lower than 700.
- Reese bass is used a lot in drum and bass.
- Side chain the other instruments with the kick.
- Short delay, also known as a "slapback"

In my cover, 1:18 is supposed to be a minor instead of a major. We're in the key of E flat and we don't ever leave the key. More or less everything has an added 6th or 7th. Also generally turn down vocals and turn up drums. 

This kind of sound shows up a lot in hyperpop, happy hardcore. Listen to Virtual Self by Porter Robinson. Also shows up in drum and bass -- listen to Wipeout soundtrack.
