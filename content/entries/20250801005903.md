At 2025-07-31 22:20:59 UTC, Leaf posted an update called [Reindexing adult NSFW content](https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content).

In it, they indicate that there is a re-indexing happening today for games that don't allow payments. They are also going to add a new “content warnings” system that all adult NSFW games must complete to be indexed. There will be a time window to complete this requirement to avoid going in and out of indexing.

Stripe confirmed that they will not be able to support adult content that is "designed for sexual gratification." Specifically, they asked itch.io to pass the following message:

> Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.

itch.io is looking for alternative payment processors to integrate with.
