Notes from Austin Glitch State:

- I brought the wrong build to the event because I forgot to run the zip script before uploading the zips! So, I uploaded old zips which contained the previous versions. Ugh.
- There's a bug when someone clicks on an item in the inventory which crashes the game. The log has an error message that says "p_child is null"
- Most players did take the staircase, but the players who did this also usually didn't play for very long. The one player that didn't take the staircase read all the dialog but thought that the staircase wasn't a clickable object because it seemed incomplete (like the playtesters from the previous 0.26 playtest)
- The cursor isn't grabbed with right click, I should do that
- Could consider adding an aim reticle when looking around.
