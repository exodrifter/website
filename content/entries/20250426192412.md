Working on _no signal_ offline:
- Copied TODOs from [20250426040622](20250426040622.md)
- Focusing on controller input stuff today
- For some reason the Sony PS3 DualShock controller I borrowed won't send D-Pad press events, but it does send D-Pad release events. Unsure if this is just how the controller works or if the controller is broken. The model number is CECHZC2M.

Tanuki:
- [ ] Make Naoko's charm model
- [ ] Switch velcro mats to something more "traditional"?
- [ ] Bobby-fy `meeting-a plan`
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in medical room
- [ ] Make models to fill drawers in workshop

TODO:
- [ ] Check to make sure drive bay keys are working correctly

Controller:
- [x] Ignore rig input when radial menu is open
- [x] Add controller support for map
- [ ] ~~Open OSD keyboard when using joystick?~~ [According to the documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/classes/class_textedit.html#class-textedit-property-virtual-keyboard-enabled), `RichTextEdit`s are already configured to do this by default
- [ ] Controller support for inventory
- [ ] Update input tutorial to show controller or mouse inputs
- [ ] Update puzzle hint to show controller inputs
- [x] Support analog input for orbit and look
- [x] Input remap doesn't focus a control after mapping is set
- [x] Mouse keeps disappearing when controller is plugged in, because there is no deadzone check
- [ ] Bindings are not being persisted after going back to the main menu or exiting the game

Part Two:
- [ ] Add poem song puzzle to music room
- [ ] Add decoy drive bays to gravity backup
- [ ] Add sliding puzzles to gravity backup

Part Three:
- [ ] Add breathing sounds
- [ ] Dynamically change resolution of cinematic
- [ ] Add cables in EVA
