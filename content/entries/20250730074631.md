I'm migrating my Tumblr data request, and I noticed two posts that were not in my old website files. The first is a draft I never published [20111007220053](20111007220053.md) and the second is a post where I announce a return to using Tumblr at 2014-01-05 07:59:11 UTC.

However, in that post, I say:

> I will be uploading a bunch of posts soon and then backdating them. From what I understand about how tumblr works, this will allow posts to have the correct date that they were originally posted, but they will still show up on the dashboard in the order they were posted. So, sorry if I happen to flood any of your dashboards momentarily.

Since all of the posts are backdated and Tumblr does not have the dates of when posts were actually created, it's not immediately clear when I stopped using Tumblr exactly.

This is what the post IDs and dates look like, in reverse chronological order:

The "local time" is clearly the timezone I was in when I dated the blog post (they all appear to be Central Time, which makes sense for this time period as I lived in Texas at the time, but Tumblr does not include the timezone. Very annoying!

Looking at the post IDs of all the posts, I can see the post I made announcing my return (post ID 72300613160). However, the posts before and after it are dated for the year 2013 instead of 2014. I'm not sure what this means.

Checking archive.org, the [earliest snapshot I can find](https://web.archive.org/web/20140820165741/https://dpek.tumblr.com/) is from 2014-08-20 16:57:41 UTC, but this is already after I had started using Tumblr as a mirror.
