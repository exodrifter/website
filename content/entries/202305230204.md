The bug was quickly tracked down. As it turns out, we were referencing the camera limits, which were in global space, and using that to clamp the player's local position.

```gdscript
func limit_camera_bounds() -> void:
	if camera:
		# Incorrect:
		position.x = clamp(position.x, camera.limit_left, camera.limit_right)
		position.y = clamp(position.y, camera.limit_top, camera.limit_bottom)

		# Correct:
		global_position.x = clamp(global_position.x, camera.limit_left, camera.limit_right)
		global_position.y = clamp(global_position.y, camera.limit_top, camera.limit_bottom)
```

I keep forgetting that `position` is for _local_ position and that if I want to modify the global position, I need to use `global_position`.
