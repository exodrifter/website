I watched an Indian action historical fiction movie tonight called _RRR_ (2022). It was a pretty cheesy film, but in a good way. I enjoyed watching it. I feel like the film did a great job developing Rama and Bheem's relationship, which I would describe as a bromance. Although they have differences in their methods of resistance against oppression, how the story turns it from betrayal to undying loyalty and camaraderie was wonderful. It actually feels really refreshing to me right now, though I can't help but feel like my opinion is be colored by the fact that I've spent the better part of the last few days watching the American TV show _Prison Break_, where such trust and loyalty is rare.

Another interesting thing about the visual style of the film that I noticed is that there are moments where the actions the characters are taking are mirrored by the crowd surrounding them. I don't think I've seen a film that uses that visual technique before and it's really sticking in my mind.
