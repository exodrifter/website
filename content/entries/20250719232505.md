At Open Sauce, outside near Hall A.

A company named Neoluthy is showing off 3d printed violins. The violins sounded surprisingly good to me, though they looked pretty bad.

I asked how expensive it was to make one of the violins, and they explained that it took about 1 roll of PLA. I'm not familiar with 3D printing material costs, so I asked them how much that was and they said around $20.
