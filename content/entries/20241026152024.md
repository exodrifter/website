I was able to clone my Obsidian notes to my phone using Termux, but I couldn't find the files in Obsidian's file picker. As it turns out, this is because Termux has its own virtual filesystem. To make the files available in internal device storage, I first have to give the application access to device storage:

```sh
termux-setup-storage
```

All this command does is open the permissions dialog for you to grant the permission. Afterwards, I have to place the files under `/storage/shared`.
