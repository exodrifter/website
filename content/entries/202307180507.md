I'm updating null to have a clock that can be referenced for when things are allowed or when npcs should take a particular course of action.

I'm trying to change the blood bank dialog so that it checks this clock, but I ran into an interesting problem where the dialog doesn't close automatically when the dialog ends.

I think this is because the code tries to `await` inside of a `_gui_input(event)` call. I'll try to have it not depend on an `await` result. In other words, the individual UI elements like the choices should not be responsible for checking if the dialog has ended; the dialog parent object should do that instead.

Making the change fixed the problem.
