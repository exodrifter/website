Leaf, the creator of itch.io, posted [a clarification](https://itch.io/post/13452559) at 2025-07-24 16:59:52 UTC on the itch.io forums about a community note on Twitter that they claimed was spreading misinformation:

> \[...\] I’m posting some more information here since there appears to be a incorrect community note on Twitter spreading misinformation that is referencing this page as source.
>
> - Pages that are “deindexed” are still accessible in your library, pages have not been removed from your collections or library as part of the broader review
> - Some pages may have received a “content notice,” there are pages where our team concluded we can’t support their business anymore. These notices apply to the individual page. Assuming the creator has not removed the files themselves or taken down the page, the downloadable files of those games are still available in your library if you have previously purchased or received a “download key”
