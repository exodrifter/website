I'm checking to verify if OffKai Expo Gen 4 was in fact the fourth time the convention has been held. Checking the [official website](https://www.offkaiexpo.com/), at the bottom I can see that they have links to the website archives for OffKai Expo 2022, OffKai Expo 2023, and OffKai Expo 2024. I don't see any other links. It seems reasonable to assume that it was the fourth occurrence of the expo.

I can see the names and dates they used for each year as well by checking the archives:

| Year | Dates | Name |
|------|-------|------|
| 2022 | April 29th - May 1st | OffKai Expo |
| 2023 | June 16th - June 18th | OffKai Expo Gen 2 |
| 2024 | May 31st - June 2nd | OffKai Expo Gen 3 |
| 2025 | June 20th - June 22nd | OffKai Expo Gen 4 |

OffKai Expo Gen 4 was the first time I attended OffKai.
