Obsidian Callouts can also be foldable if there is a plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) character right after the type identifier:

```
> [!note]-
> This is collapsed by default.
```

> [!note]-
> This is collapsed by default.

```
> [!note]+
> This is expanded by default.
```

> [!note]+
> This is expanded by default.
