I wanted to write a few things about GodotCon Boston 2025 now that I'm back home.

The [website](https://conference.godotengine.org/2025/) for GodotCon says the following about the event:

> The GodotCon is an event which aims to give the Godot community a place to meet in person and exchange knowledge. Whether itâ€™s through inspiring talks, networking, or showcasing games and projects, the event is all about building connections and exchanging knowledge. Organized by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/), alongside local community members and an incredible team of volunteers, GodotCon is a true reflection of the passion and collaboration that make this community so unique.

This is the first time GodotCon is being held in North America. It took place in Boston, Massachusetts on the days 2025-05-05 to 2025-05-07. The schedule for the entire event is [here](https://talks.godotengine.org/godotcon-us-2025/schedule/). I was busy with the showcase, but I was able to attend two workshops:

| Workshop | Speaker | Notes |

I also took notes while watching people play _no signal_ at the showcase:
- [20250506132816](20250506132816.md)
- [20250507125107](20250507125107.md)

At the end of the event they had everyone sign the GodotCon Boston 2025 banner, though not everyone remembered to do this (or was still present to do so). I also heard that all of the workshops and talks were recorded and will be posted on the [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GodotEngineOfficial/videos), but they don't seem to be there quite yet.
