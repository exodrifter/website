Watching "The Big OOPs: Anatomy of a Thirty-five-year Mistake" by Casey Muratori. 

Over 32:00 to 40:00, Casey makes the case that OOP was first invented when the Simula developers Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl at the Norwegian Computing Center in 1962 wanted to solve a code re-use problem. It just so happened that the problem was conducive to the development of virtual functions so that the subclasses could also implement their own logic.

I am almost in disbelief over this origin story for OOP, because it feels like the developers of Simula are just trying to invent functions but with extra steps.
