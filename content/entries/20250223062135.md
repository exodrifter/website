Figured I should write down the lyrics for _last night's nightmare_ that I wrote today:

let light in my journey
show me the path we take

in the night the city sleeps
on it's problems that it keeps
and we're living in the deep
but we're dreaming of release

this light in my journey
show me the path we take
this light in your journey
will show the path we take

in the night the city sleeps
on it's problems that it keeps
and we're living in the deep
but we're dreaming

if you can shake me awake, shake me awake
and don't tell me what to say in my nightmare
in this nightmare, nightmare, nightmare
and we're still looking for a way out
and we're still dreaming

if you can shake me awake, shake me awake
and don't tell me what to say in my nightmare
in this nightmare, nightmare, nightmare
and we're still looking for a way out
and we're still dreaming
and we're still dreaming

in the night the city sleeps
on it's problems that it keeps
and we're living in the deep
but we're dreaming of release

in the night the city sleeps
on it's problems that it keeps
and we're living in the deep
but we're dreaming
