_no signal_ stream 131:
- Want to focus on adding more content, so it's unlikely that I'll do much on the TODO lists today.

TODO (demo):
- [ ] Look sensitivity setting is missing
- [ ] You can drag the settings view while dragging a slider
- [ ] Use up/down controls to navigate between rows in card writer
- [ ] Keep anchor hidden after WASD movement until anchor is set again
- [ ] Maybe reduce volume of all sounds? Maybe just the safe keypad
- [ ] WASD left/right controls don't go to next row in card writer when at the end or beginning of a row
- [ ] Decorative lights for elevator room near the door should be green instead of red
- [ ] Elevator chamber shutters are visible when door is open
- [ ] Hide a fuse in the elevator room against the sides of the wall? Maybe under something?
- [ ] Add keyboard controls for chat log
- [ ] There's an item that looks like a pencil that should be labeled as a ballpoint pen?

TODO (full game):
- [x] Add a way to get into the work area
- [x] Add 2e chat logs
- [x] Add 2f chat logs
- [ ] Add lockbox
- [ ] Add 3D printer parts

- [ ] Add z and c to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise?
- [ ] Frame rate limit option
- [ ] Fuse pickup sound is missing
- [ ] 1G door closing sound and sparks sfx needs more work, also we need a particle effect to emphasize the fuse breaking
- [ ] Add door close sound
- [ ] Bedroom fixture needs sounds

**For later:**
- [ ] Sometimes the anchor point is wrong when you select an item, not sure how to reproduce.
- [ ] Add audio when hovering over door or keypad https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/0/6857382246109938235/

- [ ] [#16](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/16) Item highlight assist mode
- [ ] [#34](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/34) Add input remapping support
- [ ] [#43](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/43) Add option to toggle look and orbit controls
- [ ] [#44](https://gitea.arcturuscollective.com/exodrifter/lost-contact/issues/44) Controller support

- [ ] I could break the cassette tapes sometimes, which means you need to manually re-wind the tape back into the cassette.
- [ ] Maybe we should color coordinate drives and computers? I didn't like it when I did this today, but maybe I could approach the problem in a different way... Also, the colors would mostly be useful for people who don't read but I'm designing a game that depends a lot on reading.
