Talking about making a concept video for _dosimeter_. We want to make this in 3 months, so we should probably try to make it in 1.5 months. This gives us 4-6 weeks, and we want to shoot for a 2 minute long video.

Creative constraints:
- No focus on a mecha, or mecha fighting
- Abstract, datamoshing, kkmfd is a big inspiration (see [EXC3_CM3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1hggJOIY_c))
- No characters; faceless, low poly humanoids are okay
- We want to do some custom scored music

Ideas:
- It would be nice if the video showed some events leading up to the game.
- We want to have a lot of cuts and show a bunch of different scenes.
- Talked about doing flashbacks, like [Halo 3 ODST Live Action Trailer "The Life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSLHcAyy90)
	- We want to avoid combat, but I think the framework of representing a bunch of flashbacks from the perspective of a specific person would be interesting.
	- We could do flashbacks along with more abstract datamoshing scenes.
- Unsure if we want to show it from the perspective of the opposition or the nation homeworld.
- Maybe we could make the video about getting into the mech.
- Could try showing it from the perspective of both, and switch between technological and biological scenes.
- Showing buildings blowing up or crumbling will take too much time.
- Show simple scenes or empty landscapes, that seem abstract. If Tanuki has to model more than three things per scene, it's probably too much work.
- Neon Genesis Evangelion has a few scenes where they cut between a lot of shots that have a lot of data
- [Enter the Void Intro Title Credit Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtxgxYY7sI), we like the sequence at the end in particular
- Should feel scary and end in a cliffhanger
- Having a sound effect like this sound at [this timestamp in the NOPE trailer](https://youtu.be/In8fuzj3gck?si=uB9Qzu-Axou_DBWK&t=103) would be a good way to end the video on a foreboding note.
- We should use grainy real-life footage like in [*モーショングラフィックス "nostalmic"* by Isshin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqqIPbxf0k8)
- We feel like [*empathy for the machine* by Morph Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqqIPbxf0k8) "gets it", but we want something faster, more violent, and bad

Exo's Scene sequence ideas:
- Getting into the mech
- Dilating eyes
- Show bug tower
- Show close-up shot of fire
- Show a scene of a house or skyscraper with overgrowth and bugs
- Datamosh: The words TRUE HOME and related concepts
- Show motionless or slowly moving kaiju from far away
- Datamosh: The words DOSE-M in several different formats, flanked by gun graphics
- Eye-shaped satellite base "Ocular" arrives in LEO accompanied with a lot of smaller satellites, visible in the sky from the surface of Earth. Play a foreboding sound effect.

Tanuki's sequence ideas:
- Scene: Colonial Forces Arriving, Surveillance state
	- View of the sky (sky has abstract pattern), a bunch of eyes start opening within the sky
- Scene: Ending Cliffhanger "hopeful"
	- Red and Blue people meet first time, walk towards each other, touch hands like touching a mirror - mirror shatters
- Scene: Squish
	- Blue person meets red person, red person grows to mech size, squishes other blue people
- Scene: Desolate Waste
	- Environmental scene, town, darkened houses, linear pattern (think start of Ena)
- Scene: Datamosh 'tree'
	- Show tree growing as one of the early datamosh scenes, show it dying later in the sequence
- Scene: Datamosh "graphs"
	- Show a bunch of different graphs rapid fire that look like data from a mech
- Scene: Datamosh "Money Goes Up"
	- Show a bunch of stock-market-esque scenes
- Scene: Into the mech
	- Person within the cockpit of his biological mech, mech lid closes
- Scene: Fluid fill
	- Fluid filling the screen - alternatively, fluid filling a tank with a person inside
- Scene: Into the mech
	- Person within the cockpit of his technological mech, mech lid closes
- Scene: Wind turbine 1
	- Wind turbine in the distance, large, spinning
- Scene: Wind turbine 2
	- Wind turbine in the distance, not spinning
- Scene: Wind turbine 3
	- Wind turbine in the distance, spinning very fast
- Scene: Wind turbine 4
	- Wind turbine in the distance, broken, in pieces
- Scene: View the eyes
	- Person standing on the edge of a cliff, staring up at all the eyes in the sky
- Scene: Bombs are dropped
	- It's literally a copy from that Ena scene where bullets fall all around her [1:40 on official trailer](https://youtu.be/qLurAhsqXWc?t=100)
- Scene: Datamosh "Is This Really Okay?"
	- Large words "IS THIS" appears on the left side with "REALLY OKAY?" on the other
- Scene: Datamosh "This Really Is Okay!"
	- Large words "THIS REALLY" on the left side and "IS OKAY!" on the right
