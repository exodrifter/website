Watching third playtest for _no signal_:
- [ ] Can't change frame limit with controller
- [ ] Touching the hint button toggles it without changing the toggle state in the UI, and you cannot turn it off without resetting the settings
- [ ] Change card in real scene to the communications card so it matches dialog in communications room
- [ ] Missing color key in elevator chamber a
- [ ] chess board populates all of the pieces in a new game?
- [ ] checksum in second column of 2g card should be `1` instead of `0`.
- [ ] Chess pieces can capture themselves?
- [ ] Add 397 hint to eva?
- [ ] Add H+F hint?

This playtester (accidentally, due to a bug) didn't play the game with any hints, so they got a bit more lost than players who had hints turned on.
