Around 2025-07-26 10:00-0700, I became aware that a new set of guidelines on NSFW content had been added to the itch documentation.

https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed

It reads:

> We don’t allow hosting content that includes sexualized images or videos of real-life humans. Fictional, illustrated, and rendered content is generally fine, assuming it’s legal. AI-generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people is not allowed. Content glorifying sexual violence is not permitted. Depictions of minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors in a sexual context are not allowed and will result in account suspension.
> > Our policy is not an invitation to push the boundaries of what is acceptable. Violations that result in administrative action are permanent with no chance of appeal. Any funds on the account will not be eligible for payout. There is no second chance.
> If you plan to collect money for your content, then **you must adhere to the acceptable use policy of all respective payment processors that your account utilizes**:
>
> - [Read Paypal's Terms](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/acceptableuse-full)
> - [Read Stripe's Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)
> - [Read Payoneer's Terms](https://www.payoneer.com/legal/restricted-businesses/)
>
> The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:
>
> - Non-consensual content (real or implied)
> - Underage or “barely legal” themes
> - Incest or pseudo-incest content
> - Bestiality or animal-related
> - Rape, coercion, or force-related
> - Sex trafficking implications
> - Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam
> - Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)
>
> It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time. If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.
>
> If you've collected money while in violation of terms, we may be forced to refund or freeze all pending transactions, as **accounts that are in violation of our terms are not eligible for payouts.**

Checking the itch Discord server, I found [this bsky post](https://bsky.app/profile/papaira.bsky.social/post/3luuh5fraek2q) at 2025-07-26 04:22-0700 noting that the change was quietly updated, along with a screenshot of the list of prohibited themes.

I was unable to find an official announcement stating the change.
