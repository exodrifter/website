While investigating why my Dictionary references appeared to be aliased, [`Outfrost`](https://www.twitch.tv/outfrost) pointed out to me that this is apparently a long-standing issue in gdscript:

- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/65589

The issue is fixed by manually duplicating the dictionary so that the references become unique.
