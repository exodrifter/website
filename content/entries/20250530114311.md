A friend told me about the runtime HVM and the programming language Bend (which compiles to the HVM runtime) today, which both give you an alternative way to do computation based on a computational model devised by Yves Lafont called Interaction Combinators. It promises the ability to write parallel code without needing to deal with locks, mutexes, or atomics. It's being developed by a company called the [Higher Order Company](https://higherorderco.com/).
