I'm trying to figure out why my buttons lose focus immediately. I was able to find out how this was happening by attaching a function to the `focus_exited` signal of the button and adding a breakpoint.

As it turns out, a control that was inside of another `SubViewport` was grabbing focus. In my game, I have several `SubViewport`s in order to render UIs on quad meshes in the game world. However, it appears that when my button in the main viewport is focused, this causes the control in the `SubViewport` to get `null` when calling `gui_get_focus_owner()`.

Apparently, according to [godotengine/godot-proposals#7229](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/7229), this is because `gui_get_focus_owner()` will return `null` if the focus owner isn't a child

My code would try to grab focus when the focus owner wasn't set, and this subsequent `grab_focus()` would cause my original button to lose focus. So, it appears that `grab_focus` will also cause all other `Viewport`s to lose focus.

I think the only way to workaround this is to only grab focus when the corresponding `SubViewport` is focused and the player attempts interact with it.
