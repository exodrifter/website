I found a 2014 backup of my old website. It was originally hosted in NearlyFreeSpeech, and it's written in PHP.

I wanted an easy way to run the PHP code so I could see what the website looks like. I didn't like the idea of installing PHP and all of the dependencies needed for running a web server on my system, so I wanted some way to test it out with Nix instead. After some help from Clonk's discord server, it came to my attention that PHP has a built-in web server that I can use. So, to test my old website I just need to run these commands:

```
cd path/to/website/
nix shell nixpkgs#php
php -S localhost:8000
```
