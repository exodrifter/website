My first chord progression: Em7 F Gsus4 G -> Em7 F F(G#) C

I continued the first progression from last week and tried to extend it. He said that we're in A minor until we play G#, at which point we're in a modal mixture, borrowing from the Cmin mode by playing Fmin. Fmin and C have leading tones that are near each other

Major 4 to Minor 4 then resolving to 1 is a common progression, though it usually keeps the seventh note to tug the heartstrings or be more emotional. In this case, the Minor 4 would be a minor-major seven, which is a minor triad with major seven ontop.

A "mode" is a super-set of a scale, it can be any combination of intervals. A "modal mixture" is switching between a different scales.
