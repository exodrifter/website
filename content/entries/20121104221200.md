This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

This is a one-button game that I wrote with a few friends in the EGaDS Game Jam 2012. Our team name was "Red Sharks", which was interesting since another team nearby us decided to make a game about sharks. For those of you who don't know, the EGaDS Game Jam is a game development event where you make a game in only 12 hours. The theme of the jam that year happened to be "Red", so we decided to make a game where you were a lone samurai that defeats many enemies in his path. The better you played, the more berserk the samurai got and the redder the screen became.

The idea of the game was to have a simple idea that could be quickly developed and be very focused. We wanted every attack action to feel satisfying and rewarding, but due to the time constraints we were only able to get the basics down. I am proud of the fact that we were able to finish the game in 12 hours, but I really want to improve the game more.

Some of the artwork I did, specifically the samurai and the people, was based off of Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. The music was made by Adam Mansfield.

This game was written in Java using the LWJGL and Slick2D libraries and was finished in 12 hours on November 3rd, 2012.
