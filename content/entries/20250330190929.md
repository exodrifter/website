On Arch Linux, the `godot-fbx2gltf-bin` has been orphaned. According to the README, this is because in Godot 4.3, `FBX2glTF` has been replaced by `ufbx`.

> As of Godot 4.3, FBX2glTF is no longer used. The engine now relies on [ufbx](https://github.com/ufbx/ufbx) instead, which is a built-in library instead of an external command-line tool.
>
> As such, **in Godot 4.3 or later, you no longer need to set up FBX2glTF** to import FBX scenes.
>
> We no longer actively maintain this repository as we won't be needing it going forward. If you want to build on top of it for your own use cases, feel free to fork it.
