This data was migrated from the games database from my old website circa 2015 which I used to generate pages describing my game. I'm not sure what the dates mean exactly. It could mean the day the project started or when the project was released, but they work well enough as the date I wrote the page so I've used it for the creation date of this entry.

**about:**

Super Dissociative Tank Disorder Final Battle Royale Mayhem+ is a game where there are two teams of two people fight each other in a battle for destiny.

This game was made at the first Jolly Game Jam in 2014 with 4 other teammates. The theme was co-op, so we made a game where two players had to cooperate using confusing controls in order to win the game. Each player controls the movement of their tank and the shooting of their partner's tank and they must defeat the other team.

I coordinated the game development efforts within the group and wrote most of the menu UI code.

The game requires 4 Xbox controllers to play. The left analog stick is to move around, left and right bumper to rotate the turret, and A to shoot.
