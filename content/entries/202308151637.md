Discussing my work-in-progress song titled _fixed point_ with my music teacher.

Specifically, about this section at around 15 seconds in:

This chord progression can be called an extended Plagal cadence. This is because a Plagal cadence is usually just a `IV7 -> I7`, but here I'm doing `IV7 -> iv7 -> I7`.

Specifically, the transition from `Amaj` to `Amin` can be considered a way where I'm adding leading tones. The two flattened notes are one half step away from the notes in the following `I` chord, which makes the resolution feel especially powerful. Additionally, the very last note in the arpeggio is an added 9th, which is part of the `Amin` scale and one whole step from the root note of the following `I` chord.

The strategy of making empowering, inspiring music often uses the pattern of using two major sevenths separated by a 5th up or a 4th down like I am doing here.

He suggested I listen to the soundtrack for _Sayonara Wild Hearts_, specifically the _Claire de Lune_ rendition, which also employs similar tactics.

I asked if the song employed similar tactics to another song [_FLOATING POINT_](https://soundcloud.com/officialfroxic/floating-point) that I've been wanting to imitate for a long time and inspired the one I'm working on. After taking a listen to it, he confirmed that it also uses the Plagal cadence strategy.
