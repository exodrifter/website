Looking for an official DARPA page for the 10-Year Lunar Architecture Capability Study.

Apparently, it's also called LunA-10. its focused on moving away from individual scientific efforts and towards shareable interoperable systems which minimize the lunar footprint and create "monetizable services" for future lunar users:

> The 10-Year Lunar Architecture (LunA-10) will explore the rapid development of foundational technology concepts designed to move away from individual scientific efforts within isolated, self-sufficient systems and toward a series of shareable, scalable, resource-driven systems that interoperate â€“ minimizing lunar footprint and creating monetizable services for future lunar users.

Because of Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty (1967), LunA-10 is a scientific and peaceful study. However, it is particularly invested in creating commercial value on the Moon.
