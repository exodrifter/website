Yesterday, I tried to open my project _no signal_ on another Arch Linux computer. The most recent work I had done was to upgrade from Godot 4.3 to 4.4, and everything seemed to be fine. However, opening the project on this computer didn't work. Instead, I got the following import errors:

```

I wasn't sure what this was about, and it seemed a bit strange. I remembered that one of the recent changes in Godot was to use a new FBX importer called `ufbx` which was included in the build of Godot instead of the command line tool `FBX2glTF` which needed to be installed separately, and so I suspected that might be one of the issues. When I looked at the code for `editor_scene_importer_fbx2gltf.cpp`, I saw that all it was doing was running a command:

> [Godot 4.4 editor_scene_importer_fbx2gltf.cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.4/modules/fbx/editor/editor_scene_importer_fbx2gltf.cpp#L84)
> ```cpp
> OS::get_singleton()->execute(fbx2gltf_path, args, &standard_out, &ret, true);
> ```

Which was strange, because I was expecting it to call `ufbx` instead. Looking up the error code online reveals that error code 127 is returned on linux when the program cannot be found, and this made sense to me because I had uninstalled `godot-fbx2gltf-bin` in anticipation of not needing it anymore.

Checking the import settings, I found out that FBX assets actually have a property `fbx/importer` which can be changed between `FBX2glTF` and `ufbx`. For the files that failed to import, it was currently set to `FBX2glTF`. Changing it to `ufbx` resolved the issue.
