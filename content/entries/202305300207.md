An Obsidian Tag is a string which can be associated with an Obsidian Note.

They can be added inline to the content of the note by adding a hashtag symbol (`#`) followed by the string, or they can be added to the Obsidian Metadata.

It can only contain the following characters:
* Alphabetical letters
* Numbers
* Underscore (`_`)
* Hyphen (`-`)
* Forward slash (`/`) for Nested tags

It must also contain at least one non-numerical character.
