# Side Vegetables
Optional. This can be eaten with the pancake.
* Lettuce

This can be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge for months.

Either:

Or:
* 3/4 granulate sugar

* 1 tbsp finely chopped carrot

# Batter
* 2 cup rice flour
* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* 3 cup water

_This batter recipe might not have enough fat, coconut milk may need to be doubled._

# Stuffing
* any meat

_Not sure what the proportions of all these ingredients should be._

# Instructions
Cook the stuffing:

2. Set aside

Repeat for each pancake:
1. Heat skillet and brush oil onto pan. Then, pour a thin layer on pancake batter and cover the pan for one minute
2. Place stuffing and bean sprouts on top of the batter, then fold the pancake in half to cover the stuffing.
