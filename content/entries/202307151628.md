I've extracted from the `GameState` the following classes:
- `Strings`: Helper class for commonly used strings in dialog.
- `VoiceBanks`: Class for loading voice banks for each character.
- `Transitions`: Helper class for triggering transitions.

What's left in the `GameState` are the timers. It would be nice to save the timer values as a float in the `GameState` so that I can create save games easily, but this feels like work I could do later once we know that we actually would like to have save games.

The `GameState` feels a lot more manageable now, so I'm pretty happy with these changes.
