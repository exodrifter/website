For _no signal_ v0.32, I want to change the playtesting steps originally conceived in [20241015164902](20241015164902.md).

The game is nearing completion, so I want playtesters to start playing through the full game. Additionally, I would like to know whether or not players are understanding the story in more or less the way I intend for it to come across.

So, I want the new questionnaire to look like this:
- What is the story of the game?
- What are your own personal goals in the game?
- What do you want to see in the game that you haven't seen yet?
- Did you run into anything buggy or confusing? What were they?
- Any other feedback you'd like to provide?
- I will credit you as a playtester, if you wish. How do you want to be named in the credits?
