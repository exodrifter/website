_Midway (2019)_ is a war film about the six months leading up to and including the Battle at Midway. It was directed by Roland Emmerich, which was to my surprise as I had just recently watched another film of his, _Moonfall_ (see [20241214061514](20241214061514.md)).

I found the film to be visually spectacular, but not very interesting as it failed to get me invested in the characters who were a part of the plot. Instead, I feel like the film showed many different moments in time that led up to the battle, describing each character with a "here's what they did" without really spending much time showing what was personally at stake for those characters aside from the obvious.
