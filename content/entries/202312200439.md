Working on the lyrics:

> looking for the message you sent
> or pictures I thought i took
> thinking things i'd like to say back
> for this unrequited love
> 
> the tests to see how close we could be
> when you would give me that look
> with me, you somehow just had a knack
> for this unrequited love

I managed to tie in a rhyming scheme here across both verses, but it feels a little too disconnected to feel like the rhymes help. The "for this unrequited love" also feels stilted, and i cannot find the right rhythm for it.
