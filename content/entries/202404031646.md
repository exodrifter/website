Mixing is doing something on an individual track. Mastering happens after the file has been exported. Mastering is also about bringing things up to standard conventions for streaming services, CDs, etc.

- Add an EQ, turn down 1k, since that's where gross frequencies tend to build up.
- Add a Maximizer and set a threshold of -14
- (Optional) Add a stereo enhancer and set it to 120% to make it feel like the stereo field is bigger.
