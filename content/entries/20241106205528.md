Talking about the moon base horror game idea:
- Base on the moon, which has an alien in it
- You are an exterminator and have no idea what alien is in there
- Your company gives you a gun that is kind of useless because they don't want you to depressurize the station
- You are also given a handheld camera which is the only way you can see the alien, because it is not in the visible spectrum.
- You can only hold either the gun or the camera; you cannot use both at the same time
