I learned from a coworker that you can quickly insert the current date and time if the core Obsidian plugin Templates is enabled using the `Templates: Insert current date` and `Templates: Insert current time` commands.

There is no command for inserting both, but the settings can be changed to use a format that uses both the date and time in it or a template can be added which adds both.
