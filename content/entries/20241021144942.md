Found an old note I took at last 2D Con that reads:

> Midwest Gaming Classic in Milwaukee

This is another convention that I could consider showing my games at. Visiting the website, it appears that the event happened in April this year, and they have a dedicated part of the venue for indie game developers called "Future Classics". https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/future-classics-registration/

Indie applications appear to not yet be available, but the option to apply _is_ available, just hidden away after logging in on a different page: https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/mgc-form/future-classics-2025/

The event is scheduled for April 4-6, 2025
