Music lesson
- Listening to the chorus that I made for _in the move_ (with lyrics slightly altered from [20250325054941](20250325054941.md))
- Record another vocal track that just has the hard-to-pronounce ending on its own. Like for move, just record the buzz from the v. Try reducing the letter down to the simplest sound and layer that over.
- Think about the phonetics of vowels instead of how they are written (l-ah-st instead of lost)
- For the bridge, could use the relative major or the 6th (which would be the 4th in the relative major)
