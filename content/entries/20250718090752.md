In [How I went from $100-an-hour programming to $X0,000-a-week consulting](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_1) by Patrick McKenzie (patio11), they mention to never give a discount to clients, because they will never want to give it up. This aligns with my previous experience working at consulting companies, where the company lost quite a bit of money due to discounts that bad been given a long time in the past.
