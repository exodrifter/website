# UFO 50

UFO 50 is a period piece collection of 50 games for a fictional games company named UFO Soft from the oldschool NES era. [^1]

In general, I found many of the games to be outside of my difficulty tolerances, which prevented me from finding enjoyment in the game. Some of the games I disliked the most also had controls that I found frustrating to use. [^1]

The games I liked tended to be non-platforming games: [^1]
- *Avianos* reminds me of engine-building board games that I enjoy playing. However, it feels like most of the strategy is chalked up to rushing your opponent as quickly as possible.
- *Seaside Drive* reminds of *LUFTRAUSER* which, while difficult, I find quite entertaining because it's just fun to blow shit up.
- *The Big Bell Race* has physics which makes finding the optimal racing line interesting.
- *Velgress* is really hard, but it reminds me of *Downwell* in its snappy and rewarding gameplay.

Some notable things in other games include: [^1]
- *Night Manor*: I thought the shaking of the cursor when the antagonistic monster was on screen, was a great way to communicate the character's terror to the player.
- *Magic Garden*: I really liked the cute art in this one.
