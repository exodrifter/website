# Subject note

A [note-taking strategy](note-taking-strategy.md) where each note is mutable but contains citations to immutable notes such as [Zettelkasten notes](zettelkasten-note.md) showing how that understanding was developed. [^1] [^2] [^3]

Originally, I used [Mutable notes](mutable-note.md) to fulfill the role of summarizing information, but I disliked not having a way to check how I came to an understanding. [^4]
