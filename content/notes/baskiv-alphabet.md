# Baskiv Alphabet

The Baskiv alphabet is composed of 27 characters. All of the consonants are roughly equivalent to English letters, but vowels are more specific. Here is a chart of English sounds to Baskiv letters:

**Consonants:**

<table><tr><td>b</td><td>d</td><td>f</td><td>g</td><td>h</td><td>j</td><td>k</td><td>l</td><td>m</td></tr><tr class='baskiv'><td>b</td><td>d</td><td>f</td><td>g</td><td>h</td><td>j</td><td>k</td><td>l</td><td>m</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>p</td><td>r</td><td>s</td><td>t</td><td>v</td><td>w</td><td>y</td><td>z</td></tr><tr class='baskiv'><td>n</td><td>p</td><td>r</td><td>s</td><td>t</td><td>v</td><td>w</td><td>y</td><td>z</td></tr></table>

**Vowels:**

<table><tr><td>ah</td><td>ae</td><td>eh</td><td>ee</td><td>ih</td><td>ai</td><td>oh</td><td>uh</td><td>oo</td></tr><tr class='baskiv'><td>a</td><td>q</td><td>e</td><td>c</td><td>i</td><td>x</td><td>o</td><td>u</td><td>O</td></tr></table>

In Baskiv, words are broken up into syllables. For example, the English word "home" would be pronounced as one syllable in English. To say the same sound in Baskiv, it would be pronounced as two seperate syllables: "ho-me".

Vowels are also more specific than English. Here is a chart that describes what each vowel sounds like:

<table><tr><th>Baskiv</th><th>English</th></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>a</td><td>Pronounced like the "a" in <b>a</b>lways</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>q</td><td>Pronounced like the "a" in m<b>a</b>ybe</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>e</td><td>Pronounced like the "e" in b<b>e</b>t</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>c</td><td>Pronounced like the "e" in <b>ee</b>l</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>i</td><td>Pronounced like the "i" in <b>i</b>nto</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>x</td><td>Pronounced like the word <b>eye</b></td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>o</td><td>Pronounced like the "o" in <b>o</b>n</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>u</td><td>Pronounced like the "u" in <b>u</b>ndo</td></tr><tr><td class='baskiv'>O/oo</td><td>Pronounced like the "o" in c<b>oo</b>l</td></tr></table>

As a side note, you may notice in the above chart that O may also be written as two o's.

Other than these few points, you can in general pronounce words like you would in English.

Throughout the lessons we will be using the alphabet chart of English sounds to Baskiv letters as guidance for pronunciation.
