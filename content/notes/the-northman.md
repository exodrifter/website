# The Northman

_**The Northman (2022)**_ is an action film about a viking prince on a quest to avenge his father's murder directed by Robert Eggers. I didn't really enjoy this film as I found that the story was too fantastical for suspension of disbelief. [^1]

The film could be seen as depicting how the stories that the respective characters tell themselves and believe in propel and empower them to act in ways they do not at first naturally feel inclined to do. However, this often also resulted in the world of the film bending in order to fulfill these stories. In general, this convenient shuffling of the plot in deference of the fate that the characters believe in feels heavy-handed and cheesy. [^1]
