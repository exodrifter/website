# Everest (2015)

**Everest** is a disaster film about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. The movie itself was not terribly remarkable in my opinion, as the plot isn't terribly interesting. However, I do feel like it represents the disaster in as much of an engaging way as they could. Several of the mistakes and factors leading to the disaster were represented in the film and I can't help but feel that some incredibly bad decisions were made, like ignoring the turn around time and attempting a summiting right before bad weather was expected.
