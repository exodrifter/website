# State of Play 2025

See [State of Play](state-of-play.md) for more information about this event. Some of the trailers during the event were followed by developers commenting on their game. In general, the trailers were VERY different from the kinds of good trailers you'd see on Steam store pages. They have a lot more fun with showing off cinematics and storytelling.

| Game | Notes [^1] |
|---|---|
| *Lumines Arise* | Puzzle game by the developers of Tetris effect. |
| *Pragmata* | looks like a sci-fi action game. |
| *Romeo is a Dead Man* | animation and humor at the beginning reminded me a lot of Jerma's Rat Movie. The in-game aesthetic wasn't the same though, which was disappointing. |
| *Silent Hill f* | Horror game with creepy human-doll things? seems pretty cool. |
| *Bloodstained: The Scarlett Encampment* | Some kind of side-scrolling beat-em-up action game? |
| *Digimon Story Time Stranger* | Oh hey, a Digimon game. I don't think I've seen a Digimon game in a while. |
| *Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles* | Pretty hand-drawn art style at the beginning, but apparently it's just old-scool isometric sprites; it's an enhanced remake of the original game. |
| *Baby Steps* | Literal walking simulator. ~~I remember the developer of this being weird about their game on Twitter.~~ Can't find it. I think I misremembered. |
| *Hirogami* | Action game inspired by origami |
| *Everybody's Golf Hot Shots* | Another golfing game |
| *Nonja Gaiden: Ragebound* | 2d pixel art side scroller |
| *Cairn* | Survival climbing game. This is the only game I'm interested in. I hope it involves Bivuoacs. |
| *Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection* | Love to see game preservation happening here. |
| *Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater* | I still need to play one of these games... |
| *Nioh 3* | I don't know anything about this series. Ninja action game? |
| *Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow* | The disjointed hands are interesting, And there |
| *Tides of Tomorrow* | I really like the visual style of this. I also like how the story seemingly takes place in the great garbage patch. |
| *Astroboy* | News about a free update |
| *Sea Remnants* | Pirate game? Art style reminds me of Borderlands, but not gritty. |
| *Sword of the Sea* | Another game that looks a lot like Journey, from the people who made Journey!!! I'm very excited about this. They also made *Abzu*, which I didn't like at all actually but I would still play it. I guess I'm still trying to catch the high I got from *Journey* |
| *First Light* | James Bond movie. The facial animations are a bit stiff, but I like the style of it feeling like an american movie. i would actually try it i think. i'm interested to see how well the gameplay meshes with the story and cinematics. |
| *Ghost of Yotei* | Complete vibes, no gameplay footage |
| *Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls* | Marvel fighting game? Come to think of it, how come I've never heard of a superhero fighting game? They did a pretty long commentary after the trailer talking about the game. |
