# Development Journal

This [note-taking strategy](note-taking-strategy.md) was abandoned in favor of the [Journal](journal.md) strategy, which is more general as it doesn't require a focus in troubleshooting. [^1]

Originally, the development journal was a daily note which was appended to along with timestamps in order to describe a work session or a workday. These were eventually migrated to the [Zettelkasten Note](zettelkasten-note.md) format. [^2] [^3]

Each journal was structured with a summary of what I took note of that day followed by timestamped headings for each note. Appending to the journal with timestamps was made easier with the Template plugin in Obsidian. [^4] [^5]
