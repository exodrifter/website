# Robot Dreams (2023)

**Robot Dreams** is a dialog-free animated movie about a lonely Dog who buys a Robot companion. The movie was more whimsical and less dramatic than I expected. I couldn't help but feel like the themes of loneliness fell a bit short for me. ([20240619053222](../entries/20240619053222.md))

I particularly liked two parts in the film. The first was the beginning, when Dog sits down in their living room. In the background, across the street in another building, you can see two characters who are close to each other sit down in their living room. The kind of distance between dog's solitude and these two characters felt particularly heavy to me. The second is near the end, when Robot plays the music Dog and them bonded over, and they both dance in sync. Dog notices Robot out of the corner of their eye, and Robot hides from sight. This aspect of the story at the end, which felt like acceptance and moving on, was a nice note to end on I think. ([20240619053222](../entries/20240619053222.md))
