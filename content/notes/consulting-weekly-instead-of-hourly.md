# Use weekly instead of hourly rates

When consulting, clients will want to pay you for value that they know makes their business more profitable. For this reason, you can and should charge weekly instead of hourly rates. This also comes with certain benefits like: [^1]

- You don't waste effort itemizing the time you spend.
- You can schedule uninterrupted work in weekly blocks to work on units of work.
- You can more clearly connect units of work into to quantifiable business goals.
- You have conversations about negotiating scope instead negotiating price.
- You have better work-life balance, because clients do not feel inclined to just bill more hours in a week.

I also believe that weekly rates will result in higher-quality work, because it lets me focus on what value I can bring to the table. [^2]
