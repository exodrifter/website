# CommonMark

A strongly defined specification of [Markdown](markdown.md) that resolves ambiguities in the original Markdown specification. It also comes with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations. [^1]

It is responsible for playing a significant role in standardizing Markdown syntax across many sites and projects. [^2]
