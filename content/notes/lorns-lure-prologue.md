# Lorn's Lure: Prologue

**[Lorn's Lure: Prologue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890480/Lorns_Lure_Prologue/)** is a climbing game demo for the game *Lorn's Lure*. It's no longer on the Steam Store. [^1]

At the beginning, you don't have the picks that allow you to climb up walls, so you can only jump and fall. The momentum of the movement and the solid landings on small platforms ended up feeling quite enjoyable -- which was surprising since I was initially bummed that I couldn't climb right away and thought I might be bored until I could. Another surprise was that climbing wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. Climbing is, in general, maybe a little too straightforward. The way it works is you click on a climbable wall, and then you move around on that wall until you run out of stamina. In many ways, the climbing is just as boring as it would be in the game *Peak*, but without any of the variations to make climbing more interesting like pitons, helping hands, and changes to how well you can climb due to the weather. Overall, I felt a bit disappointed in this demo, but I really liked the ambience and mood. [^1]
