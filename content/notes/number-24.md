# Number 24 (2024)

_Number 24_ is a biographical war film about the Norwegian resistance fighter Gunnar Sønsteby who is famous for sabotage and assassinations during World War II. The film is framed by an elderly Sønsteby giving a speech to a bunch of school children, which I thought was mildly interesting. [^1]

In the film, some of the assassinations were of Norwegian citizens who were either Nazis or, like in the case of his childhood friend who attempted to give information on Sønsteby and his fellow resistance fighters, sympathetic enough to the Nazis that they were a risk to resistance operations.
