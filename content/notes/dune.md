# Dune

**Dune (2021)** is a science fiction film about the empire Imperium and the most valuable resource in the universe called spice that is being mined on a desert planet named Arrakis. It is followed by [Dune: Part Two (2024)](dune-part-two.md). In this film, the House of Atreides meets its demise after being put in charge of Arrakis, leaving Paul Atreides and his mom in exile with the Fremen. [^1]

The story reminds me a lot of the war in Afganistan and America's thirst for oil. The houses which constitute the empire also remind me of how corporations in America operate. [^1]

During the film, it is also revealed that the planet was originally to be terraformed into a planet that had water and plants but that this was cancelled after spice was discovered. I'm not sure if this could be read as social commentary for anything in particular, but I found it to be an interesting detail as it leaves Arrakis's residents in an ecologically difficult place. Though, the Fremen certainly seem to have adapted to it. [^1]
