# no signal playtesting steps

If you've been asked to playtest _[no signal](no-signal.md)_, **DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE BUILDS** and **DO NOT STREAM**, unless specified otherwise by me.

To complete the playtest, follow the following steps: [^1]
1. Record a playtest. See [How to record a playtest](how-to-record-a-playtest.md) for more details.
2. Upload the recording of the playtest to the Dropbox URL I have provided to you. I may retain the video recording in order to analyze it, but I will not store it perpetually.
3. Send me your answers to the post-play questionnaire:
	- What platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) are you playing on?
	- What is the story of the game?
	- What parts of the game were too easy or too difficult?
	- Did you run into anything buggy or confusing?
	- Any other feedback you'd like to provide?
	- How do you want to be named in the credits?
	- What price do you think the game should have, and why?
