# no signal playtesting steps

If you've been asked to playtest _[no signal](no-signal.md)_, **DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE BUILDS** and **DO NOT STREAM**, unless specified otherwise by me.

To complete the playtest, follow the following steps: [^1]
1. I should have included a save file named `save_test.bin` along with the download of the game. To use the save file, place it in the following directory:
	- Windows: `%APPDATA%\exodrifter\no-signal\`
	- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/exodrifter/no-signal/`
	- Linux: `~/.local/share/exodrifter/no-signal/`
2. Record a playtest. See [How to record a playtest](how-to-record-a-playtest.md) for more details.
3. Upload the recording of the playtest to the Dropbox URL I have provided to you. I may retain the video recording in order to analyze it, but I will not store it perpetually.
4. Send me your answers to the post-play questionnaire:
	- What platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) are you playing on?
	- What is the layout of the station?
	- What are your goals in the game?
	- What do you want to see in the game that you haven't seen yet?
	- Did you run into anything buggy or confusing? What were they?
	- Any other feedback you'd like to provide?
	- I will credit you as a playtester, if you wish. How do you want to be named in the credits?
