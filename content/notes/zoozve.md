# Zoozve

Zoozve is a [quasi-moon](quasi-moon.md) of Venus and is the first-ever identified quasi-moon in our solar system.[^1]

Zoozve got its name when Latif Nasser convinced Brian Skiff to submit a proposal to make a transcribing error official to Gareth Williams, who acts as secretary for the International Astronomical Unionâ€™s working group on solar system small-body nomenclature. [^2]
