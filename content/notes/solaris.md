# Solaris (1972)

_**Solaris (1972)**_ is a [science fiction](../tags/science-fiction.md) [film](../indices/films.md) directed by [Andrei Tarkovsky](andrei-tarkovsky.md).

It was his first attempt at making a [science fiction](../tags/science-fiction.md) film, before [Stalker (1979)](stalker.md) ([20240529050749](../entries/20240529050749.md)).

The film seems to tie the concepts of copies, reflections, and memories quite often. One particular example of this is the concept that humanity just wants more copies of Earth. First, Snaut helps Kris settle into his room by helping him make his room feel more like Earth. Later, he asserts that humanity doesn't want to conquer the cosmos and says "We don't know what to do with other worlds -- we don't want other worlds. Only a mirror." Finally, at the end of the movie we see Kris apparently back at the home where the film started. But, the camera pans out to show that the place Kris is in is actually on the surface of Solaris. Solaris is literally becoming a copy of Earth ([20240607064010](../entries/20240607064010.md)).
