Ourbs is a Global Game Jam 2012 submission that was completed in under 48 hours using the Slick2D library in a team of 4 people. We called ourselves the "Tic Tac Turtles". The theme for 2012 happened to be "Ouroboros" and we conveyed this idea by making a top down shooter game where you shot enemies with bullets. There were only a few of these bullets and when you fired them they could bounce back and kill you! If you weren't careful, you could end up losing the game due to the bullets you fired.

This game was written in Java using the LWJGL and Slick2D libraries and finished in January of 2012. You can find the Global Game Jam 2012 submission page [here](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/ourbs).
