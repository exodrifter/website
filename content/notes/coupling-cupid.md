# Coupling Cupid: Heart 2 Heart

> Don't let any of the species go extinct.

Coupling Cupid: Heart 2 Heart is a Global Game Jam 2013 submission using Unity by a team of 6 people, including me. The theme for 2013 was a sound clip of a heart beating. Originally, the plan involved having a cupid pick good matches, but over time the goal changed. We found it difficult to convey good match information to the player, so we made the game about preventing populations from going extinct instead. [^1]

During the event I did a lot of miscellaneous things like parts of the UI, some of the particle system stuff for arrows, and adding assets into the game. [^1]

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished in January of 2013. You can find the Global Game Jam submission page [here](http://2013.globalgamejam.org/2013/coupling-cupid-heart-2-heart). [^1]
