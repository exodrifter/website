# On Mars

_**On Mars**_ is a [science-fiction](../tags/science-fiction.md) board game about building the first human habitat on Mars.

**Notes:**
- The Ariel Elevator advanced building can be useful to go to orbit right before the rocket will return, but careful if the LSS is at level 3. It could upgrade to level 4 right after your turn and now you are stuck in orbit. [^1]
