# Port of Call

> Self-discovery and acceptance

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mG0E58thOE)

Port of Call is a narrative exploration game about self-discovery and acceptance. 

In the game, you wake up on a small dock with no recollection of who you are or how you got there. The first person you find is a grumpy, old man who enlists you to work on his ferry boat which seems to have materialized behind you. But not all is as it seems on this strange ship, and the people you meet may know more about your past than they let on. 

I was the lead programmer on the 6-person team and did most of the programming for the game. My proudest contribution to the game is the dialog system which leveraged existing tools to allow early, rapid prototyping.

This game was selected as a finalist for E3 College Game Competition 2014 and was created as part of the University of Texasâ€™s Game and Mobile Media Applications Program. It was made in the spring semester of 2014 using Unity3D.
