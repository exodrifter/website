# The Wild Robot (2024)

_The Wild Robot_ (2024) is about a robot who finds purpose in raising a baby goose and getting him ready in time for the winter migration. I found the movie to be really good; it was emotional, I cried a little, and it was really touching. It also uses humor at the right times to keep some levity and release tension. [^1]

One of the quotes from the movie that really stood out to me was when the fox responds to Roz's question about how he was able to tell a story about love despite claiming to not know anything about it by saying "Yeah, well, when you grow up without something, you spend a lot of time thinking about it.". I can relate to this a lot. [^1]

I really liked how the story tells many different stories at the same time. It is on its surface a story about motherhood, but is also one about purpose, self-discovery, growth, and community. [^1]
