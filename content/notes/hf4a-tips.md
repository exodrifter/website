# High Frontier 4 All Tips

- **Luna belongs to China** Be wary of China's ability to take Luna. They can ignore the requirement to get the first player's permission and, if you do not keep a human crew on your claim, they can also claim jump Luna before you can industrialize your claim. [^1]
- **Avoid belt rolls for free** You only need to do belt rolls when _entering_ a radiation belt, so you can swap to a high-thrust thruster like a crew thruster just for entering the space. You can stop on the radiation space to swap back to a more efficient thruster on the next turn. [^2]
