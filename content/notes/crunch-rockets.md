# Crunch Rockets

Crunch Rockets is a game about getting through the level without killing all of your friends in the process, because you are all equipped with these rocket launchers that automatically fire rockets every few seconds. I made this game in under 48 hours with two other friends at the 2013 SXSW Game Jam. We won an award for "Most Fun Game" and recieved free Unity Pro Licenses and a Collector's Edition of Guild Wars 2.

In order to play the game youâ€™ll need to have Xbox controllers that you can plug into your computer in order to play as we didn't have time to build in keyboard support. Up to 4 people can play and it is recommended to play with 3 or 4 people. Note that one of the players can select levels at the main menu screen by pressing up and down on the D-Pad.

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and finished in March of 2013.
