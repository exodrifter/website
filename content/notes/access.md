# Access

> A game of induction.

Access is a short visual novel where you play as Knight, who is looking for a person named Ave. You have the special ability to read the minds of others, but this leads to interesting and unobvious consequences...

This game was made for the EGaDS Narrative Game Jam in March 2015 in under 24 hours.
