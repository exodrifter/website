Spacekill is a game about killing people in space. I made this game at EGaDS Game Jam 2013 in under 24 hours while also simultaneously hosting the event.

I created everything in the game except for the music, game over sound, and the font. The credit for those sounds go to [Orbitron](http://freesound.org/people/sangardo/sounds/157363/]sangrado[/url] and [url=http://freesound.org/people/edithouse/sounds/159561/]edithouse[/url] on Freesound.org. The font I used is [url=https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron), from the League of Movable Type.

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished in September 2013.
