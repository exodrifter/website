# Orchid

Orchid is a relatively minimal real time strategy game about taking over the world with your mighty military force. It was made at Ludum Dare 28 by me, William Vickery, and Jim Nguyen. [^1]

I spent most of the time putting together the enemy AI and the overall game logic such as the control points on the map and resource income. William spent most of his time working on unit behaviour and combat mechanics. Jim made all of the images and music for the game. [^1]

The game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished on December 16, 2013. You can find the Ludum Dare submission page [here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=15471). [^1]
