# Parallel Dimension Hopper

> The worst case scenario.

Parallel Dimension Hopper is a game about an urban explorer who stumbles upon a device that shows an alternate, more extreme version of reality. The game was inspired by a creepy pasta story, [The Other Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QESMgHxo6Ww). [^1]

This game was made at the Electronic Game Developers Society 2015 Chili Jam in under 24 hours. I was the coder and writer for the game and my partner, Luben Popov, was the 3D modeler. [^1]

Here are some hints about the game that are not immediately obvious: [^1]
-  You need 4 keys to exit the apartment building and win the game
-  Keys do not disappear when you pick them up.
