# Universal snake antivenom

A person named Tim Friede has intentionally and willingly been bit about 200 times by different kinds of venomous snakes, in order to raise awareness of the issue in a dramatic way. Centivax is using his blood in the search for a universal antivenom. [^1]

In Friede's blood, two broad-acting antibodies were found that neutralized the neurotoxins of multiple snakes. Combined with a small molecule varespladib that has already been shown to work against some venoms, they were able to give mice complete protection against 13 species of venemous snakes and partial protection against 6 more. [^1]

There's still more work to be done, including animal and human trials as well as wider coverage. Centivax plans to incorporate protection against vipers, which make up half of all venomous snakes, as well. As for Freide, he actually misses being bitten by snakes: [^1]
