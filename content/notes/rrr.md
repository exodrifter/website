# RRR (2022)

**_RRR_** is an Indian historical fiction action film about two men Rama and Bheem who at first betray each other and then ally against oppression. [^1]

Another interesting thing about the visual style of the film that I noticed is that there are moments where the actions the characters are taking are mirrored by the crowd surrounding them. I don't think I've seen a film that uses that visual technique before and it's really sticking in my mind. [^1]
