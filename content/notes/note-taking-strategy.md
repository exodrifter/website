# Note-taking strategies

I use [Obsidian](../tags/obsidian.md) to take notes, but there are many ways to take notes. This documents the note-taking strategies I use and how I practice them.

# Current Strategies

There are a few note-taking strategies I am currently using in this vault:

* [Inbox Note](inbox-note.md); this is located at [Inbox](../inbox.md)
* [Subject Note](subject-note.md); these are stored under `notes/`
* [Zettelkasten Note](zettelkasten-note.md); these are stored under `entries/`

# Former Strategies

There are a few note-taking strategies I used to use:

* [Development Journal](development-journal.md); was replaced by the [Journal](journal.md) strategy.
* [Journal](journal.md); using the [Zettelkasten Note](zettelkasten-note.md) strategy instead.
* [Mutable note](mutable-note.md); using the [Subject Note](subject-note.md) strategy instead.
