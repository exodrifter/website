# Space Haven

**[Space Haven](https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/)** is a base building colony sim in early access. [^1]

In general, I found the game to be a bit boring despite liking other games in this genre like Dwarf Fortress, Banished, and RimWorld. For some reason, this game did not hook me. Maybe it was the lack of difficulty? It didn't really feel like there was a "puzzle" to solve. I liked how snappy the UI was and I enjoyed the music, but I think the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired for me. I might try this game again later, if and when it exits early access. [^1]
