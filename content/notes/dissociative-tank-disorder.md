Super Dissociative Tank Disorder Final Battle Royale Mayhem+ is a game where there are two teams of two people fight each other in a battle for destiny.

This game was made at the first Jolly Game Jam in 2014 with 4 other teammates. The theme was co-op, so we made a game where two players had to cooperate using confusing controls in order to win the game. Each player controls the movement of their tank and the shooting of their partner's tank and they must defeat the other team.

I coordinated the game development efforts within the group and wrote most of the menu UI code.

The game requires 4 Xbox controllers to play. The left analog stick is to move around, left and right bumper to rotate the turret, and A to shoot.
