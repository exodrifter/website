# Bad Code

> A game about betrayal.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_437dvzrys)

Bad Code is a visual novel game made by me and a friend at the 2014 EGaDS Narrative Jam in under 24 hours. The theme was betrayal, so we tried to make it hard for the player to tell which choice would lead to good results. [^1]

The game takes place in a distant future where androids are commonplace. You and a partner are contracted by a company to find out what's wrong with android software, as it has a bug in it that causes violent outbreaks. [^1]

I created the script for the game and my friend made all of the artwork. All of the audio in the game is in the public domain, except for the intro music in the beginning (which was composed by me). [^1]

This game was written in Python using Ren'py and was finished on February 22, 2014. [^1]
