# The Rocky Behemoth

> Rocks. Rocks everywhere.

The Rocky Behemoth is a game that I made with several other teammates at an intern organized game jam that took place over 48 hours. The theme was "And then it went horribly wrong‚Äù. [^1]

The story of the game is that you have been turned into a rock golem by a wizard. As revenge, you want to grow bigger and bigger until you can stomp the wizard by collecting rocks. The idea was that any rock you touched would become part of your body and you would inadvertently destroy innocent people's buildings as you marched onward. [^1]

I created the procedural map generation script for the game, made a script to freeze rocks if they weren't part of the stone golem yet, and created building prefabs. [^1]

This game was written in C# using Unity3d and was finished on June 30, 2014. [^1]
