# Summer Game Fest 2025

For the most part, I didn't really find the main show that interesting. It seems like Summer Game Fest was mostly for the mainstream gaming audience and as such had an over-representation of games where you shoot guns and enact violence in photorealistic settings. [^1]

Apparently, Day of the Devs is a non-profit event. I also liked Day of the Devs much more than the main show, as it had a much wider variety of games and the games on showcase were generally much more interesting. I also liked the genuine awkwardness and earnestness from the developer commentary. [^2]
