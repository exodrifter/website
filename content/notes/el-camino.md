# El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)

_**El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)**_ is a film about Jesse, after the events of the American crime television series _[Breaking Bad](../notes/breaking-bad.md)_. [^1]

Also, I didn't feel like there was a point to *El Camino*. It feels like a fan-service story; one that is just a wish-fulfillment story for Jesse. It doesn't feel like it has much to say and the story just meanders around. [^1]
