# Breaking Bad

**Breaking Bad** is an American crime television series about an overqualified chemistry teacher named Walter White who becomes a methamphetamine producer and distributor. It was followed by *[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)](el-camino.md)*. [^1]

I was did not like how the series ended, as I felt that the ending was too kind to Walter. As Watler becomes a drug kingpin, he constantly reiterates to himself and to others that he's only making methamphetamine and selling it for his family. However, even though his continued involvement rips the family apart, he continues to do it. It's only at the end that he finally admits to his wife Skyler that he did it all for himself. This fantasy of being the family's provider was a core pillar of his sense of worth and ego, and it consumes him and those around him. [^1]
