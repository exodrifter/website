# Minty Relaxation

> A unique twist on the endless runner genre.

Minty Relaxation is a game that I made in under 72 hours with one other person for the Ludum Dare 26 Jam. The theme was minimalism. We decided to implement this idea by using a one button control scheme and using monochromatic artwork. Initially, the game was about collecting pieces of trash that would stick to you and make you go faster, but then it evolved into a game about ground pounding the edges for more points.

This is the first game I made in Flash. I spent most of my time changing how to game responded to your actions, tweaking physics, and programming the gameplay logic.

The game was written in ActionScript using the Flixel library and was finished in April 2013. You can find the Ludum Dare submission page [url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=21625]here[/url].
