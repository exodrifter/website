# Wonka (2023)

**Wonka** is a musical fantasy film prequel about Wonka before the events of the film *Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory* directed by Paul King. [^1]

I found an emotional connection with Wonka, as it's a piece of media about how it feels to _make_ things. The main character, Wonka, is relatable too. Like me, he is naive. He could be having a much easier time if he would just compromise on his values and aspirations, or even just give up on making chocolate entirely. [^2]
