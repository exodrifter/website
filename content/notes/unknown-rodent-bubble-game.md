# Unknown Rodent and Bubble Game

The unknown rodent and bubble game is a video game that I played in my early childhood and is the earliest video game I remember playing but have not been able to identify. [^1]

I have pretty high confidence that this game: [^1]
- Involved some kind of cartoony rodent (mouse or rat) and bubbles
- Was rendered with a side perspective
- Was a 2D game with 3d-rendered sprites
- Was played on a desktop computer sometime between the years 1993 and 2000

Details I am less confident about include: [^1]
- The bubbles floated up from the bottom
- The levels were very colorful
- Each level was timed
- You were trying to rack up a high score
- You were trying to save the rodents from the bubbles

Due to the lack of preservation for games from this era, it may be very difficult if not impossible to find this game. [^2]
