# Dharma Doujo

Dharma Doujo (だるま道場) is a puzzle arcade game released in 1994 by [Metro Corporation](metro-corporation.md). You can play it in your web browser on archive.org [here](https://archive.org/details/arcade_dharma) ([20240528062117](../entries/20240528062117.md), [20240528062731](../entries/20240528062731.md)).

The goal of the player is to clear the blocks by creating rows of a single type in the gutter at the bottom. This is done by hitting the left-most block in a row into a chute which will re-stack the blocks in the gutter at the bottom. If the row is all of one type, then the row is cleared and removed from the board. Otherwise, the row is pushed back up onto the board at the bottom. There's also a mechanic for losing if the blocks get pushed off the top or if the time limit runs out which happens when the crab reaches the top ([202305311447](../entries/202305311447.md)).
