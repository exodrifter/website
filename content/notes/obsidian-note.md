# Obsidian Note

A plain text or markdown file in an [Obsidian Vault](obsidian-vault.md) stored on the local file system.

# How to use

Notes can be given multiple names by adding [Obsidian Metadata](obsidian-metadata.md) to the note's frontmatter. Giving a note multiple names increases the probability that I can link the note to other notes and allowing me to find it in autocomplete more easily.

> [!warning]
> Before renaming files, ensure that the name of the file isn't currently being used as the display text for any links in the vault. If a link is, add the current name of the file as an alias before renaming the file. If this is not done, the display text used in the link will also be updated to the new name of the file. See: [Link display text is not immutable](obsidian-link-diplay-text-is-mutable.md)
