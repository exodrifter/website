# Venba

**[Venba](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/)** is a short casual narrative cooking game about Tamil cuisine. [^1]

The is because the story shows the stress caused by the differences in culture that arise between the child and parent, and some elements of reconciliation as they grow older. The story doesn't develop much or go as deep as I would have liked, but it is also quite a short game -- only at an hour long. The game is beautiful and I was surprisingly familiar with a few of the recipes covered in the game, though I certainly want to try making all of them now. [^1]
