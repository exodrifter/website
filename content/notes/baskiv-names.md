If your name is Stacey (<span class="baskiv">stqsc</span>), then you can say what your name is with the following:

> <span class="baskiv">sol stqsc rova.</span>

The literal interpretation of this sentence is "I am Stacey". It is ambiguous whether or not the second word in the sentence is a name or just another object. Therefore, the meaning of this sentence depends on context. However, if you wanted to be more specific about it, you could say this:

> <span class="baskiv">sol xvOko stqsc rova.</span>

Roughly translated, this means "I am named Stacey." Being specific can be useful if your name could potentially be assumed for something else. For example...

> <span class="baskiv">sol bo rova.</span>

...could mean "I am male". However, if you name was *actually* <span class="baskiv">bo</span>, you could make this clear by saying this instead:

> <span class="baskiv">sol xvOko bo rova.</span>

In order to ask a question, it is sufficient to add the correct query word at the beginning of the sentence. For example, to ask for someone's name:

> <span class="baskiv">tome xvO rova?</span>

The literal interpretation of this sentence is something along the lines of "What are you named?". As you can see, the subject of the sentence was assumed to be "you". All query words will change the assumed subject to the person or thing that the speaker is talking to.

If you wanted to ask who someone was, you could say:

> <span class="baskiv">dxme til rova?</span>

Roughly translated, this means "Who are you?". In this sentence, it is not necessary to say the second word, <span class="baskiv">til</span>.

---

You can say what someone else's name is by using the correct pronoun as the subject of the sentence. For example...

> <span class="baskiv">til xvOko stqsc rova.</span>

...means "He/She is named Stacey". Unlike English, use of the gender-neutral pronoun is not considered offensive or derogatory. If you know the gender of the person, you can say "He is named Stacey" or "She is named Stacey", respectively:

> <span class="baskiv">bo xvOko stqsc rova.</span>

> <span class="baskiv">rq xvOko stqsc rova.</span>

## Example

> <span class="baskiv">jon: silko nalva!</span>

> <span class="baskiv">stqsc: xvOko stqsc rova.</span>
> <span class="baskiv">kodc: tome til xvO rova?</span>
> <span class="baskiv">jon: rq stqsc rova.</span>

> John: Good morning!
> Stacey: Hello!
> John: I'm John. What is your name?
> Stacey: My name is Stacey.
> Cody: What is their name?
> John: She is named Stacey.
