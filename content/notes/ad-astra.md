# Ad Astra

_**Ad Astra (2019)**_ is a psychological science-fiction film about an astronaut Major Roy McBride who travels into space to find his long-lost father H. Clifford McBride. [^1]

I found it interesting how the idea of contact is present in several different ways. In the most obvious sense, Clifford is fully dedicated to finding signs of alien life, refusing to accept defeat when he finds proof that humans are alone in the known universe. However, most everyone else in the story is trying to make contact with each other in one way or another -- and everyone seems to have trouble doing so. [^1]
