# Ms. Splosion Man

> I only did QA testing for this game.

I performed quality assurance testing for Ms. Splosion Man, a sidescrolling 3D platforming game made by Twisted Pixel Games by filing new bugs and doing regression testing, among other things.

To be honest, I'm not really sure how much I can say about my work on this game (In fact, I'm not absolutely sure if I can use that image you see above. I believe it's covered under fair use, though.); however, I can say it was a very fun experience and I really enjoyed working with the folks over at Twisted Pixel Games.

The game was released in April 2013, and you can get the game at a variety of places which are all linked to on the [url=http://mssplosionman.com/]official site[/url].
