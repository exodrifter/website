# 10-Year Lunar Architecture Capability Study

https://www.darpa.mil/program/ten-year-lunar-architecture-luna-10-capability-study

The **10-Year Lunar Architecture Capability Study (LunA-10)** is a scientific and peaceful study conducted by [DARPA](darpa.md) to explore the development of shareable interoperable systems which minimize the lunar footprint and create commercial value. [^2]

In August 2023, [DARPA](darpa.md) requested ideas for the study. [Northrup Grumman](northrup-grumman.md) proposed a robot-built lunar rail network. There are several benefits that a rail system would provide, according to Northrop Grumman: [^1]
- It would not kick up dust like rovers
- It would avoid littering the surface of mars with vehicles that are left behind
