# Rotary effect

The rotary effect simulates the sound of a rotary organ. [^1]

Rotaries modify the sound by modulating the gain, pitch, and panning of a sound. All of these parameters fluctuate between a lower and upper value, and usually at different frequencies. [^2]

This kind of effect was originally introduced by the Leslie cabinet. [^3]
