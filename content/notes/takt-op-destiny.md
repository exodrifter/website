# takt op.Destiny

_**takt op.Destiny**_ is an action science-fiction anime about a world in which music is no longer commonplace due to an alien invasion of monsters called D2s which are attracted to and aggravated by the sound of music. [^1]

I'm not sure that it counts as a paradigm shift anime from just the first episode. Even though the show only has a few moments that show the effect of the change, they are framed as describing a change that has already happened. [^1]
