Teleport Man is a rougelike platforming game where you play as an escaping genetic experiment that has the powers to teleport. It was made during the UT Austin Game Development Capstone in the Fall of 2013. [^1]

This game was written in C# using Unity3D and was completed around the end of 2013. [^1]
