# Midway

**Midway (2019)** is a war film directed by Roland Emmerich about the six months leading up to and including the Battle at Midway. [^1]

I found the film to be visually spectacular, but not very interesting as it failed to get me invested in the characters who were a part of the plot. Instead, I feel like the film showed many different moments in time that led up to the battle, describing each character with a "here's what they did" without really spending much time showing what was personally at stake for those characters aside from the obvious.
