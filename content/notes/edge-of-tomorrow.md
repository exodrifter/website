# Edge of Tomorrow

**Edge of Tomorrow (2014)** is a science fiction film about a cowardly public affairs officer named Cage who gets stuck in a time loop fighting an alien invasion. The film notably showcases the use of exoskeleton suits as a way to make soldiers more effective in combat. However, it falls short of examining the impacts of any part of its premise, preferring instead to focus on telling a story about Cage's redemption. [^1]

The closest the movie gets to being about paradigm shifts is when Cage meets Dr. Carter for the first time, and Dr. Cage knows that it's the first time because Cage doesn't know how many fingers he's holding behind his back. This is the only time in the story when the effects of time travel on how other people who don't experience time travel behave are examined, and it reminds me of how adventurers with the time-travelling ability are exploited in the manga _My Sister and Giant: A young lady is reborn in another world_.
