Baskiv sentences use Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order. For example, the equivalent of the English sentence "I love you" in SOV order is "I you love". There are also more complex sentence structures that Baskiv uses, but these will be covered in later lessons.

In the Baskiv language, there are no words that are only verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Instead, nouns are converted to verbs, adjectives, or adverbs by using the corresponding suffix. For example, the word in Baskiv for "greeting" can be changed to a verb by appending the verb suffix <span class="baskiv">-va</span>.

So, to say hello to someone:

> <span class="baskiv">sol fq nalva!</span>

And to say goodbye:

> <span class="baskiv">sol fq hqsva!</span>

It is important to recognize the distinction between the suffix <span class="baskiv">-va</span> and <span class="baskiv">-mana</span>. <span class="baskiv">-va</span> is used when the subject, in this case the speaker, is doing the action. Because of this, it is possible to say hello to someone by only saying <span class="baskiv">nalva</span>; it will be inferred that the speaker is greeting someone or something. On the other hand, if <span class="baskiv">nalmana</span> is said instead, it will be inferred that the speaker is describing a person or thing that is greeting the speaker.

In Baskiv, the words for morning, afternoon, evening, and night can be
changed into an adverb to describe a verb with the suffix <span class="baskiv">
-ko</span>. For example, to say good morning, good afternoon, good evening, or
good night:

<table><thead><tr><th><u>English</u></th><th><u>Baskiv</u></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Good morning.</td><td class="baskiv">silko nalva.</td></tr><tr><td>Good afternoon.</td><td class="baskiv">alko nalva.</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td class="baskiv">elwolko nalva.</td></tr><tr><td>Good night.</td><td class="baskiv">gulko nalva.</td></tr></tbody></table>

It should be noted that the above sentences make the assumption that the
speaker is saying hello to whomever they are talking to. Additionally, the
phrase for good night in the above table does not imply sleep; it is just a
greeting given at night. To bid someone farewell at night, you would instead
say <span class="baskiv">gulko hqsva</span>.
