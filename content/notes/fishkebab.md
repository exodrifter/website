# Fishkebab

> Probably my worst game.

Fishkebab is a gameplay mechanics experiment that I made in the summer of 2013. [^1]

The point of the game is to try to harpoon the greatest number of fish. Since there is a lack of explanation for the controls: Press space to switch into harpoon mode and click to harpoon the fish. [^1]

It was written in Java using the libGDX library and was finished in the Fall of 2013. [^1]
