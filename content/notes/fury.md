# Fury

**Fury (2014)** is a fictional war film about a tank battalion during the last days of WW2. One particular aspect about this film is that it showcases the contrast in capability between the American and German tanks was something alluded to in the beginning of the film. It also shows the development of brotherhood in the tank battalion after the main character Norman joins the crew. [^1]

The film managed to retain my attention through the acting and action scenes, but I don't think this film was really worth watching. It doesn't really feel like the film has a strong theme or message that it's trying to share and it's not enjoyable to watch. [^1]
