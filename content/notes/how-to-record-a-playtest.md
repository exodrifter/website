# How to record a playtest

These are general instructions for how to record a playtest.

When playing the game, please record yourself playing the game with a hot mic. Your honest in-the-moment reactions are invaluable for making the game better. Please use the opportunity to talk about what you are thinking about as you play. [^2]

To record a playtest, you will need the following programs: OBS and Handbrake. [^1]

1. Before recording your playtest, make a short test recording with OBS to check your audio levels. Play some music while you record and talk out loud a few times before stopping the recording. You should be able to hear yourself talk and you should also be able to hear the music. [^1]
2. After making the recording, use Handbrake to compress the video to a smaller file size. If you don't know what preset to use, I recommend using the `Official > General > Very Fast 1080p30` preset. [^1]
