# Obsidian

A note-taking app which uses [Obsidian Flavored Markdown](obsidian-flavored-markdown.md) files as its file format of choice. In particular, it has very good tools for connecting notes to one another including:

* A graph view to visualize connections between notes
* A list of backlinks for a note (notes which link to the note you are viewing)
* A list of outgoing links for a note (notes linked in the note you are viewing)

It is also highly extensible and configurable.

# Features

Obsidian has the following base features:

* [Obsidian core plugins](obsidian-core-plugin.md)
* [Obsidian Flavored Markdown](obsidian-flavored-markdown.md)
* [Obsidian Note](obsidian-note.md)
* [Obsidian Tag](obsidian-tag.md)
* [Obsidian Vault](obsidian-vault.md)

Obsidian's functionality can be extended using Community Plugins.
