This is a math game that I wrote in order to learn how to program games using the Slick2D engine. In this game, I learned a lot about how games are structured, how they run, and what I could do with the Slick2D library. Most of the sounds, music, and graphics were also made by me, but I had a good friend do the announcer voices for me (as it turns out, it is really hard to do an announcer voice that sounds good).

It's a relatively simple game where the player has to solve math problems that get harder over time in order to score more points. The more problems the player solves, the more time the player gets in the round; however, if the player answers any problem incorrectly the time for the round gets shorter. The goal of the game is to score the most points before the round is over.

After completing the game, I released the game along with the source code to the Slick2D community. You can find that thread [here](http://slick.ninjacave.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4291).

This game was written in Java using the LWJGL and Slick2D libraries and was finished near the end of 2011.
