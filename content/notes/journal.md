# Journal

A journal is a [note-taking strategy](note-taking-strategy.md) which I abandoned in favor of [Zettelkasten Notes](zettelkasten-note.md). [^1]

Originally, the journal was a collection of daily notes connected by some topic of interest which were appended to with timestamps. This was very similar to the [Development Journal](development-journal.md) strategy, but not necessarily about work. [^2] [^3] [^4]

Each journal was structured with a summary of what I took note of that day followed by timestamped headings for each note. Appending to the journal with timestamps was made easier with the Template plugin in Obsidian. [^5] [^6] [^7]

These were eventually migrated to the [Zettelkasten Note](zettelkasten-note.md) format. [^1]
