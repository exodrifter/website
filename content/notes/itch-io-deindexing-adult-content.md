# itch.io mass deindexing of adult content

In the evening of 2025-07-23 pacific time, itch.io deindexed all adult content without notice, then posted an official announcement claiming it happened because of the Collective Shout campaign. This campaign had caused the removal of adult games from Steam just about a week prior.

Before this event happened, itch.io had built a reputation for being one of the coolest places online, because of its censorship-free and artist-first reputation. [^5] In fact, in 2022 itch.io had posted [this tweet](https://x.com/itchio/status/1478123227394150400) in the wake of [Game Jolt banning adult games](https://nichegamer.com/game-jolt-has-banned-porn-games/): [^4]

Around 2025-07-24 00:00 UTC, all adult games on itch.io had been delisted. [^3]

At 2025-07-24 06:07:43 UTC, itch.io posted an [official announcement](https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content) claiming this happened because of Collective Shout's [open letter](https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors) and associated campaign to direct concerns about the nature of certain content found on Steam and itch.io. They claimed that it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice and apologized for the abruptness of the changes. They did not confirm what kinds of content would be allowed or not, but said that they were conducting a review of all adult content. [^1]

At 2025-07-24 16:59:52 UTC, itch.io posted [a clarification](https://itch.io/post/13452559) for a community note on Twitter that they claimed was spreading misinformation. They said that deindexed pages are still accessible in libraries and that pages have not been removed from collections or libraries as part of the broader review. For pages that received a content notice, downloadable files of those games are still available in libraries if you had previously purchased the game or received a key for the game and the creator has not removed the page themselves.
