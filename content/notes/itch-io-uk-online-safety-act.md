# itch.io response to the UK Online Safety Act

At 2025-07-27 22:08 UTC, itch.io made [a statement about the UK Online Safety Act (OSA)](https://itch.io/t/5133739/our-update-on-the-uk-online-safety-act). In it, they say that adult content will not be available at all to UK visitors until they find a solution that complies with the act. Just like the [deindexing of adult content due to Collective Shout campaign](../notes/itch-io-deindexing-adult-content.md), this currently does not affect the ability to download content already in a user's library. [^1]

In their statement, they also express their disagreement with the OSA and encouraged readers to express their concerns by reaching out to advocacy groups, local representatives, and by signing a petition. [^1]
