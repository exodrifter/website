# Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)

_**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**_ is a [post-apocalyptic](post-apocalyptic.md) action [film](../indices/films.md) and is a prequel to _[Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)](mad-max-fury-road.md)_.

It feels like this film primarily preoccupies itself with using the protagonist Furiosa as a vehicle for delivering world-building information to the audience. It doesn't feel like Furiosa changes much as a person, the story fails to develop a narrative tension, and the car chase sequences are not as satisfying ([20240530040419](../entries/20240530040419.md)).
