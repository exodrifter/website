# Faster delta time on some hardware

In _no signal_, I noticed when a player was playing the game that the letter in the wordmark for a player spins faster than it's supposed to. I was unable to determine the reason; I could not replicate it, and it appeared that I was using the `delta` time correctly. [^1]

This users's system specs were: [^1]
- Intel i7-10700K @ 3.80GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10 GB)
- 64.0 GB RAM
