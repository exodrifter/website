# B612

B612 is a font which, in addition to being designed specifically to "improve the display of information on the cockpit screens", was open sourced by Airbus in 2017 under the Eclipse Public License and in 2018 under the OFL. [^1]

Despite the claim to legibility, I found the following issues which make it problematic for use in a programming context: [^2]
- By default, the `0` and `O` characters are not easily differentiable (See [polarsys/b612#20](https://github.com/polarsys/b612/issues/20))
- The `.` has a kerning which aligns it to the left instead of centering it between glyphs, causing version numbers to look odd
- The `[` and `(` characters look similar (See [polarsys/b612#25](https://github.com/polarsys/b612/issues/25))
- The `:` and `;` characters look similar and are very small
- The `` ` `` and `'` characters look similar
