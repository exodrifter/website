# Hamilton: An American Musical

_**Hamilton: An American Musical**_ is a biographical musical about the life of Alexander Hamilton.

Something I noticed about the musical is that it makes use of [leitmotifs](leitmotif.md). Parts of previous songs that have been sung already will be echoed again to show what the character is currently thinking of or how they feel. It's nice because it recontextualizes what the words in the song means and it can change the meaning of what has been said ([20240602191042](../entries/20240602191042.md), [20240603031855](../entries/20240603031855.md)).
