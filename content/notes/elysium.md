# Elysium

**Elysium (2013)** is a film about parolee Max Da Costa who is struggling to turn over a new leaf in a world where people on Earth are incredibly poor and disadvantaged and the rich and powerful live on a space station named Elysium orbiting Earth. Elysium has many luxuries and benefits, including most notably med-bays which are capable of healing (almost) any disease or physical damage. [^1]

Elysium has a lot of social commentary in it, putting topics such as immigration, worker exploitation, and social class dynamics front and center in the story. However, I didn't feel like the story really got to do much exploration of the changes in society as a result of the technological advancements shown in the story. For example, although it is mentioned that the med bays can reverse aging, we don't get to learn of how society on Elysium is different due to the citizens effectively having immortality. We see Max building the same droids that are used to oppress him, but this also fails to become a salient point in the film. Although the details are there, I think the lack of follow-through on them causes the social commentary to fall a bit short. [^1]
