Chancetime is game submission to Scopely's Challenge at the UT Austin uMAD event. Given the fact that it had to be done in less than 8 hours, it's a ridiculously ambitious game that has a large number of features that were actually implemented into the game.

In case the [site that outlines the details of the contest](http://challenge.hiddenswitch.com/) is down or has changed, the challenge was to create a game that represented collaboration by achieving at least one of the following: Use of 2 or more fingers, use of 2 or more characters in the game, could be played on 2 or more platforms, was developed by 2 or more developers, could be played by 2 or more people simultaneously, or could be played by 2 or more devices that were networked together.

We (there were about 5 of us) implemented all 6 of these criterea. But although the game was technically impressive, the game was not much fun to play.

I contributed to this game by creating music, creating prefabs in Unity, and by helping debug problems near the end of the jam.

This game was written in C# using Unity3D and was finished in the morning of February 8, 2014.
