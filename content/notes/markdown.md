# Markdown

A plain-text formatting syntax. It also comes with a Perl script which can convert that syntax into HTML. [^1]

It was designed to make it easy to read, without appearing as if it had been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. It was inspired by the format of plain text email. [^1]

Unfortunately, although it became quite popular, it was not very well specified and has resulted in many different [Markdown flavors](markdown-flavor.md) over the years. This divergence was later addressed by the [CommonMark](commonmark.md) specification. [^2]
