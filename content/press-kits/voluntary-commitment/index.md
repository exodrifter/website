# history

In early 2023, Iron Circus Comics and Indiepocalypse partnered to create a collection of collaborative game projects. Each game project was a pair consisting of a comics artist and a video game developer. Evan wanted to work on a game about a nightmarish Kafka-esque bureaucracy and I wanted to make a game about my past experience of being committed to a psych ward against my will, so we paired up. In July 2024, this bundle was successfully funded on [Backerkit](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/iron-circus-comics/iron-circus-x-indiepocalypse-say-hello-to-iron-circus-games).
