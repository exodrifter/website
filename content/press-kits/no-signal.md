# no signal

_**no signal**_ is a science fiction escape room game about loneliness, fixing broken machinery, and reading old logs. You're stuck by yourself on a space station orbiting a black hole, trying to get home. There's no one to call for help.

# history

For a few months, the idea of telling a story about loneliness, how it affects you, and how you can use cognitive reframing in those kinds of situations preoccupied my thoughts. I wanted to tell an emotionally powerful story that many could connect with and take away a positive outlook from and in December 2023, we made a prototype for a hidden object game to do just that. The development of the game has been streamed live on Twitch most weekdays since then and it is planned to be released sometime in winter 2024.

# features

- no signal's camera controls allows you to clip through geometry and view an entire scene like a diorama in a way that allows you to examine the scene from different perspectives.
- find all of the components to fix broken machinery and fix corrupted data on computers.
- read about the main character's relationship to everyone else who left the space station before them.
