# history

In the spring semester of 2014 at UT Austin, a 3D Capstone game development course was offered. I was part of a six-person student development team, primarily responsible for the narrative framework for the game. At the time, there were not very many resources available for narrative content in Unity 3D, so I wrote code to parse Twine and Ren'py scripts so that they could be used in the engine. In the summer of 2014, _Port of Call_ was accepted as a finalist to the E3 Student Game competition. In 2015, Port of Call was successfully greenlit on Steam and added to the store.
