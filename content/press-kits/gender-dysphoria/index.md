# history

i was trying to be a full-time indie developer for the first time in my life at the time i made this game. i was working on a different game and i was deeply dissatisfied with it, burnt out, extremely depressed, and lonely. so, in the summer of 2020 i decided to try and find my passion for game development again by doing a short game jam, just for myself, originally just to prove the capabilities of the [narrative scripting language](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor) i had designed. on a spur of the moment, i wrote about my feelings about gender dysphoria and released it. i found that people kept playing it, so i felt motivated to work on it more and added voice acting and controller support. it was released on steam in april 2023 and made available in pizza pranks videogame tape club in january 2024.
