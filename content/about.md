# about me

<div class="home-banner">

![](blog/avatar.png)

I'm **exodrifter** (she/her), a Cambodian American indie game developer, vtuber, functional programmer, and musician based in Austin, Texas. I love yuri, space, and heavy board games. Making games that connect with people in emotional and meaningful ways is my passion.

I'm currently working as an indie game developer making games in Godot, much of it live [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_). In the past, I've worked in the logistics industry as a Haskell developer and in the dataviz and archviz industry as a Unity VR developer. In college, I was the President of the student-run game development club Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS) at The University of Texas at Austin during the school year of 2013-2014.

I love to write software that boosts the productivity and experience of others, especially across disciplines. If you're looking for a developer that loves this kind of work for a video game or functional software project, I'm your girl! I won't work in gambling or military though. Take a look at my [resume](resume.md) and [reach out](contact.md).

# about this site

This website is primarily a digital garden, which is a collection of files linked together to make a web of interconnected relationships. To do this, I use a [note-taking strategy](notes/note-taking-strategy.md) where I record [Zettelkasten notes](notes/zettelkasten-note.md) in [`/entries`](entries/index.md) which are then used to create [Subject notes](notes/subject-note.md) for browsing in [`/notes`](notes/index.md).

I write and publish my notes publicly because it gets me to think more carefully about whether or not what I'm writing down is comprehensible and correct. I care a lot about being able to explain things well, so I have found this to be an enjoyable process.

Other parts of the website include:

| Folder   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [/albums](albums/index.md) | A showcase of music albums I've released. |
| [/blog](blog/index.md) | My personal blog. |
| [/gallery](gallery/index.md) | A showcase of visual art, both original work and fanart. |
| [/press-kits](press-kits/index.md) | Press kits for games I've worked on. |
| [/tags](tags/index.md) | A listing of all tags used to tag files on the website. |
| [/vods](vods/index.md) | An archive of recorded live streams. |

The code for the website is available on GitHub at [exodrifter/website](https://github.com/exodrifter/website).
