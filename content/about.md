![](blog/avatar.png)

I'm **exodrifter** (she/her), a Cambodian American indie game developer, vtuber, functional programmer, and musician based in Austin, Texas. I love yuri, space, and heavy board games. Making games that connect with people in emotional and meaningful ways is my passion.

I'm currently working as an indie game developer making games in Godot, much of it live on Twitch. In the past, I've worked in the logistics industry as a Haskell developer and in the dataviz and archviz industry as a Unity VR developer. In college, I was the President of the student-run game development club Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS) at The University of Texas at Austin during the school year of 2013-2014.

Opportunities to work on video games and functional software interest me. If you want someone like me on your team, I'm open to it. [See resume...](resume.md)
