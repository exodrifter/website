looking for your text
pictures I took next
recall how it went
in my lonely love

x-ray, my mind
your gaze, those eyes
heart pierced, how kind
i cried, many times

things i would say back
you just had a knack
to know what i meant
in my lonely love

online, ghost touch
your voice, that sound
held close, so much
in warm tears i drowned

you say we never change
i tried to fix my ways
it can seem so strange when
things remain the same

online, ghost touch
your voice, that sound
held close, so much
in warm tears i drowned

you say we never change
tried to fix all my ways
but things remain
but things remain
