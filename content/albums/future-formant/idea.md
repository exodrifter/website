imagination is cheap to you
if only you could see this too
you say that ideas are what you do
if only i could see that too

in the gardens you can grow
someplace you can take it slow
and some neighbors who say hello
a place you don't play alone

imagination is cheap to you
if only you could see this too
you say that ideas are what you do
if only i could see that too

in the place i made for you
in here you can find it too
but you said no i'll go alone
i'll take my chances solo

in the gardens you can grow
someplace you can take it slow
and some neighbors who say hello
a place you don't play alone
