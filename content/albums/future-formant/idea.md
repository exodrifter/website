imagination is cheap to you<br/>
if only you could see this too<br/>
you say that ideas are what you do<br/>
if only i could see that too<br/>

in the gardens you can grow<br/>
someplace you can take it slow<br/>
and some neighbors who say hello<br/>
a place you don't play alone<br/>

in the place i made for you<br/>
in here you can find it too<br/>
but you said no i'll go alone<br/>
i'll take my chances solo<br/>
