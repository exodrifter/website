coffee drinks are bittersweet
memories of you
addicted to another waking
moment of you

and then the sun sets
i have to work again
imagine shadows
to keep me company

hypnotic rhythm
nodding off now and then
it's all so breathless
a silent symphony

but days fly by
before my eyes
memories are lost

forgetting to
remember all the
moments with you

but days fly by
before my eyes
memories are lost

forgetting to
remember all the
moments with you

but coffee drinks are bittersweet
memories of you
addicted to another waking
moment of you

but coffee drinks are bittersweet
memories of you
addicted to another waking
moment of you
