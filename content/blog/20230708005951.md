# started making clips during my streams

![](20230708005951-clip.gif)

They more or less summarize what I've done, which is quite nice. Here's a few of them for the game I'm making in Godot!
- ðŸ’¬ Cute dialog sounds! [clips.twitch.tv](https://clips.twitch.tv/HelplessClearSoymilk4Head-tKkwoTKSHgXE5H78)
- ðŸ“„ Stamping documents! [clips.twitch.tv](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrepuscularConcernedAsparagusOneHand-pYEHdx03dyJggjKO)

Feel free to [follow me on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_), I stream game development most weekdays! âœ¨
