This build includes the following bug fixes:
- Fix the letter in the wordmark jumping when returning from the settings menu.
- Fixed many spelling/grammar issues in the text logs.
- Fix freeze/crash when accessing the EVA computer caused by a bug in Godot's UI API and triggered by movement input (including from unused plugged in controllers) from the player.
- Add missing undersides to rugs.
- Prevent letter in wordmark from spinning too quickly.

The following issues are known but not fixed in this build:
- One player reported a lighting issue in the center, where it loads in completely dark while playing a game. Reloading the game fixes the issue. If you run into this, please reach out with more information.

If you have any problems with this build, please report the issue on the [itch.io](https://exodrifter.itch.io/no-signal/community) or [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/) forum. On Steam, you can roll back to a previous build using the beta branches feature while you wait for a fix.
