# a reminder

indie game development is hard

I'm sure you don't really need to hear this from me. There's plenty of easily-found videos, in-dept articles, and conversations between game developers out there attesting to this very fact. It's hard to make a game, it's hard to get people to buy your game, and there's so much competition to be in this space.

Internally, I'm really conflicted about sharing what I'm doing. I want to make emotional games that really meaningfully connect with people. I want everyone who is interested to see and know about my work, but in talking about my work I sometimes feel like I cheapen the value of the connection I am trying to make.

So, my strategy up to this point was to make every post I write a high effort one. And, frankly, I just want it to be; I want everything I make to be meaningful. But, since I don't post very much about what I'm doing, the laws of marketing (which I despise) tell me that you probably don't know what I'm doing. So, here's a reminder of pretty much everything that I'm doing:

- I'm still streaming game development most weekdays [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_). I'm almost done making a public demo of _no signal_!
- You can [wishlist _no signal_ on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840590/no_signal/).
- You can still buy _[Gender Dysphoria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310400/Gender_Dysphoria)_ for $3. You can play it for free on itch.io, but this way you can gift _Gender Dysphoria_ to someone on your friends list.
- [I'll be at 2D Con](20240616051537.md), in the Indie Island space, showing off the _no signal_ demo and selling physical copies of _Gender Dysphoria_.
- _voluntary commitment_ is part of the Iron Circus Comics and Indiepocalypse videogame bundle, which will have [a backerkit page live in a little over a week](https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/f525f31f-6452-4506-826e-5446d71fc65e/landing).
- Did you know [a Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2024/06/03/iron-circus-comics-teams-up-with-indiepocalypse-to-crowdfund-videogames/?sh=7fdc42b26dbe) was written about the Iron Circus Comics and Indiepocalypse videogame bundle recently?
- I started taking notes publicly and you can read them on GitHub at [exodrifter/logbook](https://github.com/exodrifter/logbook). I'm hoping this will also make it easier for me to make more posts in the future.
- I made an invite-only indie game dev forum called [t/suki](https://forum.tsuki.games/) because [I feel like I haven't found the community space I'm looking for](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/why-i-made-t-suki/85). Recently, I finished playing _In Stars And Time_ for [the book club thread](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/t-suki-book-club-in-stars-and-time/144). Do you want to join? Let me know and I'll try to figure out how to invite you.
- If you like my work, you can support me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/exodrifter) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/exodrifter). I don't really post supporter-only content much because I'd rather make as much as I can completely public, but the funds really do help a lot.
- I'm also working on [Ultraprocessor Ribbon](https://cohost.org/exodrifter/post/6446399-i-am-in-this-photo) from time to time with Demuresoft.

Wow! That's a lot. It also just sunk in recently that I have _three_ Godot games in various stages of completion that I think all have a good chance of shipping, which is kind of insane. But, I am also deeply thankful for my situation. Anyway, I'm going to try to post more reminders of what I'm doing, but I'll still try my best to follow the spirit of doing meaningful things.
