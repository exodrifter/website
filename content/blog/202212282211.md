# VOD archive

![](20230109015650-vod-website.png)

Yesterday, I built a new website to host my VODs publicly: [https://vods.exodrifter.space/](https://vods.exodrifter.space/)Â 

For now, it only includes VODs from this month. This _does_ mean that access to the full VOD archive will eventually be dropped as a patron perk as I manually migrate each VOD over to the new platform by hand and delete the old Patreon posts. This also means I won't spam patron emails by posting VODs all the time.

I've been wanting to do this work for a really long time. No one really watches VODs as far as I can tell, so making them more available affords me the opportunity to reach more people. I'm pretty sure no one will watch them even then, but I want to do it.

Anyway, VODs are _much_ easier to view now as well. You can filter by year, by category, and by tag:

And there's a search feature, though it's pretty scuff:

As usual, the vimeo chapter markers are still available and the viewing experience feels a lot better than on Patreon.

For now, I'm tagging videos based on what tool what was in use, the piece of music I was working on (being able to see all of the streams where I worked on a particular song has long been something I've wanted), which guests made an appearance, and what game I was playing.

If you have any suggestions for how to make the VOD site more useful for you, feel free to let me know here or on Discord!
