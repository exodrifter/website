# new game at next fest

After making _[Gender Dysphoria](../press-kits/gender-dysphoria.md)_, I quit my job to make _[no signal](../press-kits/no-signal.md)_ and it has a demo out now! As it is currently part of [Steam Next Fest](../notes/next-fest.md), it would mean the world to me if you tried it out before the event ends on October 21st at 10 AM PT.

If you aren't familiar, Steam Next Fest is one of the biggest digital events for indies to show their games to new people. Each game can only participate in the event once, so it's very important to me that this goes as well as it can. However, Steam decides which games to show to people based on how people interact with the demo during the event, which means that people have to play my demo in order for it to get shown to others.

Steam Next Fest is happening _right now_, and it would mean a lot to me if you took some time, earlier the better, to play the _no signal_ demo on Steam, before the event ends on October 21st at 10 AM PT.
