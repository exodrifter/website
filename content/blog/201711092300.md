# Suspect Pictures

![](201711092300-suspect-profiles.png)

The case file in Access is a folder full of suspect pictures and other documents. Each suspect in the story will have their own picture, and depending on the agent you're playing as, you may see different information in the UI near the picture.

The suspect pictures are intentionally vague, as we'd like to keep the focus on the narrative and writing. They do look quite nice though.

You can see some of the potential suspect pictures in the featured image of this post, but it would be nice to have more to choose from. If you'd like, take a photo of yourself against a plain wall, and send it to me! I'll process it and place it in the pool of suspect pictures. I can't guarantee it will get into the game, but it may!
