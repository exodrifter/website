# the recorded data living room and dialog

![a camera shot looking out from the shelf of a bookcase with the last two dialog lines reading "ethyl: You know how I was visiting my parents a few weeks ago? Well..." and "me: Yeah" with a single dialog choice "Wait"](20230614025154-1.png)

![a camera shot looking out over a bay window and a chair in the corner with the last two dialog lines reading "ethyl: Do you think of yourself as a workaholic?" and "me: What, to avoid thinking about the state of the world? Yeah, maybe, but ironically I end up spending most of my free time thinking about the state of the world anyway." with the dialog choices "I am a workaholic.", "I'm just being pragmatic." and "Wait"](20230614025154-2.png)

@Titanseek3r finally sent me the level geometry for the living room scene and I put the level in [yesterday](../vods/20230614012732.md) while I was streaming on Twitch. It was nice to see the dialog I wrote for _the recorded data_ with the scene in the background!

I have been pretty dissatisfied with the story over the last few months, but this is reinvigorating me to do better. Working with teammates is great!
