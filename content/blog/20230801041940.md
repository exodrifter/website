# when the flowchart loops...

Played Bureaucracy (1987) on stream yesterday, which is a very funny interactive game about bureaucratic nonsense written by Douglas Adams (author of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_). I enjoyed reading the manual a lot, which was full of funny little gems like:

- An intentional typo at the end of a long example which switches the digits in one of the dates
- Inconsistent requirements or rules
- Time windows that don't make any sense

You can watch the full VOD ad-free on [my website](https://vods.exodrifter.space/2023/07/30/1836).
