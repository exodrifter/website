# ðŸ“… 2023, week 11

Happy daylight savings time? The clocks where I live have jumped forward one hour, and I hate that we have to do this every year. Maybe one day I won't have the UTC offset changing on me arbitrarily.

I've been pretty excited about development on _null_. Here's what happened last week:
* Created a new repo for _null_ so I can collaborate with my partner. ðŸ“¦
* Set up a character controller script, so you can walk in the environment!  ðŸš¶
* Fixed bugs in the camera code causing unexpected behaviour. ðŸ“¹

In general, _null_ is already starting to feel a little bit like a game now that you can freely move around in the world. Next, I'll be working on adding a way to interact with things placed in the world. evandahm will also be joining me on Tuesday's stream to work together on the game.
