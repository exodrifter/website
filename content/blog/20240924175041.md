# post exclusivity ending

Hello skeletons! Now that the social media platform cohost! is shutting down, I decided to build a [new website](https://www.exodrifter.space/) for hosting all of my notes and blog posts.

Something that is often on my mind is how I could be better at marketing while keeping my personal principles in account. I've talked before about how I think [Patreon and Ko-fi are endpoints in a marketing strategy](202212270805.md) and how I wanted to try posting more content in open public places. The end of cohost!, where I practiced much of this, has caused me to re-evaluate how that went. Although not excellent, I feel like this strategy works with my principles and has been more effective. So, I would like to apply this strategy more broadly.

Just like I did [with the VODs](202212282211.md), I'm going to migrate all of the exclusive posts I've made on Patreon and Ko-fi to the website for everyone to see. The only difference is I won't delete the old posts; they'll still be here on Patreon although they will be made public. I will also start crossposting posts here, since my website doesn't have a way for people to leave comments.

This change is something I'm excited about, since it will allow me to present my content in a way that simply isn't possible on crowdfunding platforms.
