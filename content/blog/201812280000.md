# Streaming Schedule

Hey everyone! I want to start having a regular streaming schedule for when I make music. If you're interested in watching, let me know which days are the best for you!

Whatever day works best for y'all, I'm planning on doing an hour-long stream once a week in the evening, probably starting around 6pm-8pm. The poll will close in a week.
