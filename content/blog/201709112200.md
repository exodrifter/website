# Tankmeld

![](201709112200-tankmeld.png)

I've been taking a short break from Access, because I've been a bit tired of just programming systems. I also wanted to give you all something nice this month for being my patron, so I decided to start working on a new, improved version of [Super Dissociative Tank Disorder Final Battle Royale Mayhem+](https://exodrifter.itch.io/super-dissociative-tank-disorder). I plan to finish and release this game by September 29th.

Most of the assets in the game are not original; the only model I created is the tank and all of the sounds and music are either public domain or require attribution. However, I was able to hire a musician ([Jeff McMillen](https://www.jmcmillenmusic.com/)) to write an original track for the game, in part thanks to the money I've received this month from you all.

Today, I finished the basic gameplay loop. If you are a $5+ patron, look forward to another post in about an hour that includes a demo and an explanation of what's done so far.
