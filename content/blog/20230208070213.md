# soft femdom is the best, and other more serious thoughts

May I respectfully turn your attention to _I’ll serve you well, Senpai~ ♥♥♥_ by Mitsumoto Hiyori, which you can read [here](https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/ill_serve_you_well_senpai) (CW: drunk sex). It's good, I like it a lot. It's okay, I'll wait. Take your time.

You're back? Okay, great. Because I have a problem. You see, I think a lot about supporting creators I like. It's obvious that you were just able to read it for free, which is pretty typical for manga and hentai nowadays, but the creator doesn't really benefit from that. And that's a problem for me because I want more of this kind of content -- how can I expect to receive more if I don't help the creators I like create the stuff I want?

For manga, this answer is pretty easy to find; just simply purchase the work when it gets translated to English and add another physical item to your collection (I dislike this process a lot, but that's a topic for another time)! But when it comes to hentai, the process of finding a way to support the artist I like is much more difficult for me. Am I just not informed?

Here are the obstacles I run into:
* Understandably, the author's social media is exclusively in a language I cannot read.
* The works I want to read never get an official English translation, nor am I ever aware of a place where they do. It is also not obvious where to buy the untranslated work they made because they are sold on sites I am not familiar with and/or are in a language I cannot read.
* I don't know how to support directly with money, like I would for someone on Patreon, because these artists usually use sites I am not familiar with that don't have an English localization.

And this is a big problem for me because I like specific things and there's not nearly enough of the things I like, a constant fact that frustrates me. Does anyone know? How do I support artists I don't know how to communicate with?
