I spent much of this last year struggling with mental health. Times whenÂ I would feel like there was almost nothing I could do have turned into absolutely hopeless moments where I felt like there was actually nothing I could do. It's hard for me to understate how rough it has felt for me.  
  
I've been trying to hang in there and I know this last year has been rough for many of us. I hope you're hanging in there too. I didn't make nearly as much progress this year as I would have liked to but I'm looking forward to seeing what the next year brings.  
  
Thanks as always for the support, and I hope you enjoy the music <3
