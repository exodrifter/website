# ✨ schedule for the first week of the year! ✨

![exodrifter's catgirl vtuber avatar looking at the camera surrounded by sparkles on a background of repeating green hearts.](20221230152104-image.png)

The first week of the year is upon us and I am returning to streaming once again. ❤️

The last few times I streamed, I finally hooked up the [eighth rewrite](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gz-ACunh_Fo) of my inventory system library back up to Godot and made a few short-form videos in Shotcut!

In the coming days, I'm:

- **Playing Snake Pass**, a platforming game with an interesting movement mechanic that involves slithering around like an absolute maniac. This game has been on my backlog for a long time and I'm really looking forward to seeing how they implemented the controls.
- **Working on my game in Godot** again, but this time I'm going to pivot from making an inventory management game to making a smaller game about grid coverage as a stepping stone to the bigger game I want to make.
- **Mastering music in FL Studio** for the upcoming personal tradition of releasing an album on my birthday. I don't have that many tracks, but maybe I can squeeze a sixth track in before release?

I hope to see you around!
