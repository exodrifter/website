# Current Setup

![](201708152200-setup.jpg)

I figured I would write a quick note for you all about what I'm currently using as my setup, since I just cleaned my desk. (Sorry for the phone picture quality, I don't have an actual camera)

The table is a Uplift Desk, but I'm not terribly fond of it. It is useful for changing between sitting and standing but it was quite expensive, it's a little wobbly, and it is so heavy and hard to move.

I'm also set up right next to my "backyard" which is literally just a concrete pad. I get a nice amount of sunlight this way though.

# Audio

- Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (First Gen)
- Presonus M7 microphone
- Portable microphone stand
- Audio-Technica ATH-M20
- Presonus Eris Monitors
- KRK Systems Rokit 10s Subwoofer

The Presonus Eris Monitors are actually really old so there's some weird cabling going on there. The monitors actually connect to each other using a non-protected speaker wire which can get really annoying sometimes because of the electrical interference that happens sometimes.

The subwoofer was gotten used from Guitar Center, and it's pretty old too. It also has some damage on one of its corners, but it still works like a champ.

I also have a standing microphone stand, but it's sitting in my closet right now.

# Snow

Snow is my old desktop computer. It's the mid-size tower that's sitting on the floor. It has a bunch of data on it that I still haven't transferred to Rain. I mostly use it as a server sometimes. I actually don't remember what's in it exactly, but it does have two SLI'd Nvidia cards.

# Rain

Rain is the new desktop computer sitting on my desk that I'm currently using. It is a small form factor build and sometimes I actually take it out of my house to coworking events and stuff.

The SSD that I was using as my primary storage actually failed recently, and I can't RMA it, which is why I have yet to transfer all of my data over from Snow.

**Preipherals:**

Fun fact: I actually bought the mouse in Stockholm, Sweden.

# EDC

I usually keep my everyday carry next to my keyboard. Here's what it is currently:

- SunplusTrade Business card holder
- Wallet (Not sure what brand anymore)
- Samsung Avant Cellphone
- House Keys
- Car Keys

There's a swiss army knife next to my EDC, but I don't normally carry that around. And if you're wondering, yeah, my cellphone has a name. It's Roze.
