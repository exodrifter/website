# type theory is impenetrable

So I'm trying to learn more about type theory because I'm trying to implement type inference for my dialog scripting language, [rumor](https://github.com/exodrifter/rumor). I'm reading this paper [_A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus_](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/LambdaPi.pdf) and it's pretty comprehensible when:

> The type language of λ→ consists of just two constructs:
> ![An evaluation in λ→ written in mathematical syntax, which reads: e ⇓ v / e :: τ ⇓ v, / x ⇓ x, e ⇓ λx → v v[x 7 → e′ ] ⇓ v′ / e e′ ⇓ v′, e ⇓ n e′ ⇓ v′ / e e′ ⇓ n v′, e ⇓ v / λx → e ⇓ λx → v](20231027035311-image.png)

fam, that looks like five things.

also, wtf are these symbols, you going to explain them?

uh, these are just more symbols i don't recognize?

well, okay then.
