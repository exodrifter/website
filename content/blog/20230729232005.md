# First Godot PR

A few days ago I was floored when I finally found a **[code crime](../notes/godot-crimes.md)** in Godot: a function which lies about what it does.

```gdscript
func is_hole(outline: PackedVector2Array) -> bool:
	# Note that holes are counter-clockwise, but Godot's function
	# to detect clockwise polygons is backwards.
	# See godotengine/godot#49716
	return Geometry2D.is_polygon_clockwise(outline)
```

Infuriatingly, I found out that this problem had been identified [two years ago](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49716) and no one has fixed it. TWO Y-- oh yeah, that's right. I'm not using Unity3D anymore, Godot is open source, I can actually fix things like this now.

So, I took a bit of time this morning to fork Godot, make the corresponding changes, and open a [pull request](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80035).

What a nice experience! My time with Godot continues to outshine Unity3D at every turn.
