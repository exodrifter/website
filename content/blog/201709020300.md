This track will be part of the January 2018 album, which I have yet to name. I also posted this on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/exodrifter/when-i-saw-the-sea-i-thought-of-you).

I wrote this track thinking about the sea and a friend that I used to hang out with a long time ago. One time I stayed with them and some of their friends that I didn't know very well at a beach house in Galveston, Texas. They all got _very_ drunk - at the time, I refused to drink, so I went to sleep instead.  I didn't sleep very well; one of them frequently went to the restroom to throw up. Very early in the morning (about 4 am) I woke up and went out to watch the sun rise with my friend. It was really windy and brisk.... the sea smelled really nice and everything was really peaceful too.

Whenever I'm around the sea, I tend to think about that time.
