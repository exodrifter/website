I'm trying a new thing where I post tracks leading up to the album's release! This is the first of five tracks, so there will be four more coming out before the album comes out on January 22nd. HQ download at the bottom, as always (in FLAC format, this time).

There are a lot of difficulties in life. Often, we think of them as being in front of us -- in the future. But, sometimes they also weigh on us after they've passed. The picture is from when I was in the hospital to be treated for pneumonia when I was only a few years old. I almost died from it, so it felt particularly concerning when I caught pneumonia again last year.

I hope I don't catch it again.
