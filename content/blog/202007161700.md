# Gender Dysphoria Early Access

I decided to make a game a few weekends ago, in my own personal game jam starting on Friday and ending on Monday. I decided to make it about my negative experiences after coming out as transgender, and I've finally gotten around to packaging it up so you can download it!

You are a skull patron, so you have early access to the game. I wish I did more writing over the weekend during the game, but taking the time to re-live the negative experiences and materialize them in written form took a lot more out of me than I expected.

Right now, the game has four arcs. I'd like to add one more arc and add in more choices to the already-existing dialog. Early access will probably end whenever that is done; I'm guessing it will take about a month.

I will probably have more to say about this game when early access ends, but please do enjoy in the meantime, and let me know if you come across any problems running the game.
