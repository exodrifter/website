# Access Hiatus

It's been just a little more than three years ago when I started working on this game, and I have some bad news to share.

Bridgette, the writer on the project, has decided to leave the project. I have some understanding of why and I don't fault her for this decision. I wish her the best on any future projects she may work on and I am very happy I got the chance to work with her.

This puts Access in a rather vague position. While Bridgette has expressed interest in finding a writer to continue the story and we plan on meeting to discuss specifics regarding that, it's not clear to me right now if I will want to continue working on the game.

For now, Access will be going on haitus until further notice. I will be spending the next few months working on some long-neglected tasks on my open source tools such as the many improvements I want to make to Rumor. During this time I'll contemplate what I want to do next (like if I want to leave Access behind and start on a new game) and conduct a search for a new writer.

I hope the story of Access doesn't end here, but it may stay in this unfinished state for quite a while.
