# no signal @ San Japan 2024

![A picture of one of the rooms in no signal with the San Japan logo ontop of it.](20240623220847-san-japan.png)

I will be tabling at San Japan this year on August 30th to September 1st in San Antonio, TX. You can get tickets [here](https://www.san-japan.org).

I'll be showing off a demo of _[no signal](../press-kits/no-signal.md)_ in Hall 3! It's a week after [2D Con](20240616051537.md) but I'm looking forward to the convention. I hope I have enough energy for it 🥴
