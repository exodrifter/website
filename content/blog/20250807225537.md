# no signal v1.5.3

This build has the following fixes: [^1]

- Stairs sometimes required more than one click to interact with, it should work on the first click now.
- If you toggled look input, you could not move the mouse after opening the inventory, map, or notes with a shortcut key.
- Colors have been corrected on the puzzle cube
- Billiard balls have textures now
- Fix inset bed model clipping issue

If you have any problems with this build, please report the issue on the [itch.io](https://exodrifter.itch.io/no-signal/community) or [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/) forum. On Steam, you can roll back to a previous build using the beta branches feature while you wait for a fix.
