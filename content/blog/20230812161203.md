# looking for job

I've been doing deep technical work over the last few years but now I'm looking for a new job with more creative work or leadership and management challenges. Any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer are greatly appreciated as well as rechosts. I wanna get that job!

## what makes my background unique?

I've launched three games on Steam ([Port of Call](https://store.steampowered.com/app/356520/Port_of_Call/), [Teknedia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/354780/Teknedia/), and [Gender Dysphoria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310400/Gender_Dysphoria)), done professional Haskell development for 5 years, and professional VR/Unity3D development for 2 years.

I also stream game development and music production regularly on Twitch! You can see my full work history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/exodrifter/).

## what am i looking for?

I want to do more interdisciplinary work, preferably with more leadership or management opportunities.

I'm interested in the following types of positions:
- Team Manager for an interesting indie game or software project
- Senior Software Developer working on interesting, crunchy technical puzzles
- Something related to writing game development tools

If you have any opportunities, advice, or connections, I would love to hear from you in the comments, by dm on [Mastodon](https://vt.social/@exodrifter), or by email (exodrifter at gmail).
