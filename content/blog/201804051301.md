# Sickness

![](201804051301-iv.png)

Last week I got rather sick and went to a doctor to get some medical advice about it. However, a few days ago my symptoms got even worse, and then I found myself in the ER yesterday morning with an IV connected to my arm.

welp.

It was interesting to see how the IV drips worked, how the CT machine worked when it scanned me, and the conversations I had with the staff were interesting too.

It makes me wonder what the rest of their days are like, like the busy ones. It sounds like fun to make a narrative game about working at an ER, but that's probably just me.

Anyway, I'm resting up with so many prescriptions now and I hope to be better in a few days so I can start working again.

Thanks for all of your support! Normal posts will return shortly.
