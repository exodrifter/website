# ðŸ“… 2023, week 8

It's been a quiet week for me, as I spent a significant amount of time trying to figure out how to get macOS builds signed and notarized for release on Steam instead of streaming, but in short... I gave up on it! Maybe I'll write a post about it. Anyway, here's a summary of what's going on:

- Shia and I are still doing our weekly parkitect playthrough! I think we're going to play Western Roundup next. ðŸŒµ
- One of the last things I want to do is make a trailer before I submit _Gender Dysphoria_ to Steam for review. I'll be working on that this week on stream. ðŸŽ¬
- This week, I'm switching over to making music (and maybe some sprites) for nme's cool and nifty arcade-themed website. ðŸŽ¶
- The Expanse TTRPG Cupbearer campaign ended last week! I'll be learning the next prebuilt campaign, so there won't be a TTRPG session this week. ðŸ“š

I miss streaming and hanging out with everyone. See you all soon!
