# Having a difficult time

Hey everyone, I'm going through a difficult time right now. I'm sure I'll get through it eventually... but of course it's hard to tell from here.

I know that I haven't posted updates on my game in a while and I would love to do a few that I have had planned for quite a while, but it might be a bit longer until then. Updates will be more sporadic than usual and I may have to cancel some of my music streams.

For this reason, I am pausing my patreon creator account, meaning that you will not be charged next month. I will still post things when I can and you should still be able to access the content I have previously posted.

Thank you so much for your understanding and support.
