# Back from vacation

Happy holidays! It's 2018 now! Several things have happened!

Right before I left for family vacation, the other SSD on my computer failed. I will be doing an RMA on it this month, but for now Rain is out of commission. I did set up Snow back to normal-computer-use instead of server-use, so for now I can still work! I'm just sad i keep having problems with my "new" computer though.

I spent a lot of time while travelling during vacation working on Rumor. I have a new compiler and I have addressed quite a few tickets that were opened on github over the break. I just have a few more API changes and a lot of unit tests to write, so look forward to that soon!

I hope I'll have an update for Access soon, but for now there isn't much to say about it since both the writer and I have been a bit busy. Soon, hopefully!

It is my birthday soon though, which means I will release a new album soon (it's a personal tradition of mine)! I'm frantically trying to wrap it up, because my standards have suddenly spiked and, well, albums need songs in them. So look forward to that... in fifteen days! Hopefully.
