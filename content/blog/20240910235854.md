# no signal demo

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed8CmFCwBzI)

The demo for _[no signal](../press-kits/no-signal/index.md)_ is now available! I've spent a lot of time working on this and I hope the demo captures your interest and makes you excited to see what's next. As for the full game, I still would like to finish it before the end of the year, but we'll see if that happens as most of the rest of the game doesn't exist yet! I have a lot of dialog to write and puzzles to create in the next few months.
