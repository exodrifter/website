Suddenly felt like making music after listening to some tracks on Soundcloud. Specifically, I found [_ollie - day 1_](https://soundcloud.com/totototoro/day1) to be rather inspiring, despite otherwise feeling more or less indifferent about the music.

I wanted to make something that sounded happy but foreboding, in an unsettling kind of way. The music took a bit of an interesting turn halfway through, in a sort of child-like way, but I think I really enjoy that part of the song as well.
