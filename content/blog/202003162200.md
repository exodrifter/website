# Hamburger Bed

![](202003162200-birch.png)

So when I adopted Birch, I got him a cat bed, which I refer to as the hamburger bed despite it not really resembling a hamburger. Anyway, I cleaned it recently and I found him like this one morning, legs sticking out and all. He stayed there all morning for like, 4 hours. What a content kitty.
