# cables

![A picture of the reactor room, which is lit in red lighting. The reactor is visible, a ladder to the right partially obscures the view, and there are a bunch of cables clamped to the floor.](20240528072954-image.png)

I learned how to add procedural geometry using Godot's built-in CSG tools and now I have wires and cables everywhere.

# quick guide for how to do this

In Godot, first add a `Path3D` and give it a curve. Remember that you can use an orthographic view to make it easier to move and place new points on the curve!

Next, you'll want to add a `CSGPolygon3D`. It represents a 2D shape that will be extruded to create a 3D one. Go ahead and customize the shape if you want to. In the screenshots I showed in the earlier post, I wrote a script that generates a circle, but for this example I'll keep using the default square shape.

Then, change the `mode` to `Path` and set the `path_node` to the `Path3D` we created earlier:

And there you go! It kind of looks like an air duct. You can play around with the path settings in the `CSGPolygon3D` to get the shape/divisions you want.
