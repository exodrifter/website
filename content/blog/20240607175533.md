# logbook

As a streamer, I've been asked on occasion if I would share the notes I am taking on stream with everyone. I haven't in the past because I would also take notes that I wasn't sure I felt comfortable sharing publicly. However, this is changing! I've decided to start taking notes publicly and you can now see them at [github.com/exodrifter/logbook](https://github.com/exodrifter/logbook).

Ever wonder what someone else's actual Zettelkasten notes look like? Want to see what I think about [Stalker (1979)](../notes/stalker.md)? Maybe you want to see solutions for [Godot issues I've run into](../tags/godot.md)? Maybe you're wondering [what indie devs think about marketing](../notes/marketing.md)?

You can also open this vault in Obsidian to see the graph, if you fancy that:

In general, it will be easier to navigate the notes in Obsidian (or some other note-taking tool) as you'll be able to navigate through backlinks. The notes are also pretty sparse as of this writing! I will be adding more to it over time and migrating older notes when I feel comfortable doing so.

I'll also be trying to use these notes as a way to make it easier to write more posts in the future, but this way you can see what I'm taking note of more quickly! Is taking notes publicly a good idea or not? I'm not sure! I guess we'll find out together.
