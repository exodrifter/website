Not really. Before you get excited, a most unfortunate turn of events caused the meeting to fall flat on its' face, resulting in my friend not showing up. However, another one of my friends, who is making the music, showed up and the resulting meeting looked like this:

Awkward, I know. We didn't get much done and the meeting was called to an end after 1.5 hours.
