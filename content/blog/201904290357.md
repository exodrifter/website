# Access Dev Update 2

![](https://vimeo.com/573303919)

I forgot to use my pop filter! I'll do my best to remember to use it next time. Lots of very noticeable improvements, but there's still plenty more to do before I can do my next playtest.

A behind-the-scenes video of me attempting to make Foley sound effects for the game is coming soon in a week or two!
