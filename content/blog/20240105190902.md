# new website

![A screenshot of the exodrifter.space website at the time of the post. There's a sidebar on the left, with the following elements arranged vertically: exodrifter logo, cohost link, discord link, twitch link, horizontal rule, bandcamp link, github link, itch.io link, ko-fi link, mastodon link, patreon link, soundcloud link, steam link, twitter link, vods link. The main content to the right of the sidebar is titled "games" and is followed by a three slightly darker boxes arranged vertically containing the title, release year, working title, status of the work, and a description of the work for the games lost contact, voluntary commitment, and gender dysphoria.](20240105190902-current.png)

I made [new business cards](20240102014850.md), so I wanted to update my website as well! You can see the new design here: https://www.exodrifter.space/

The old website was just a clutter of icons on a video background:

![A blue background with glowing squares fading into the distance with a black, slightly transparent box ontop. It has the exodrifter logo followed by buttons arranged in a 3x4 grid, with links to bandcamp, cohost, discord, github, itch.io, ko-fi, mastodon, patreon, soundcloud, twitch, twitter, and vods from left to right, then top to bottom.](20240105190902-old.png)

There were a few things I wanted to fix about that:
- It's not clear which links are more "important".
- It's not very clear what I'm about.

So, I updated the website to prominently display only three links: [cohost!](https://cohost.org/exodrifter) (the wonderful site you are on right now), [Discord](https://discord.gg/arqFQVt), and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_). Then, I added a short portfolio to the side. I'm pretty happy with it!
