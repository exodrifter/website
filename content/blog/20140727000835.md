# Glass Bubble Week 3

This is development week three out of eighteen for Glass Bubble. The previous week's devlog can be found [here](20140720015346.md).

I didn't feel like I got much done this week. Despite having done so many times, I still find UI programming extremely frustrating sometimes.

I did manage to write a UI system that allows me to add items to a box and have it automatically resize to fit the content. You can see an example of what I'm accomplished below:

However, in doing so, I have not utilized the animation code that I made for the mock UI stuff I made in an earlier week of development. I feel like I should go back and salvage that code, since it looks so awesome, but I also feel like I won't get to it. I still have a lot to do with the UI system.

Namely, this week, I need to hook up the UI system to player input and the Ren'Py library that I've written. Once I've finished that, I'll be able to have interactable dialog in glass-bubble!
