# no signal release date

I'm happy to announce a release date for *no signal*: July 25th, 2025 at 21:00 UTC.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvTReqELJUI)

The game will be available on [itch.io](https://exodrifter.itch.io/no-signal) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840590/no_signal/).

I've been able to slowly work on the game since [the hiatus](20250317203824.md) I took in March in order to move away from Texas. It's been really difficult to get to this point, but I'm really eager to get the game in the hands of players and friends.

The game is complete, awaiting Steam's approval, and an updated demo build is now available on Steam. The saves and achievements are cross-platform and are shared between the demo and the full game, so you'll be able to take your progress with you to the full game when it comes out. If you have made a save before this update, I'm sorry to say that you'll have to start a new game.

Although the game is complete, I've set the release date one month out to give me time to do some marketing for the game and for press and influencers to have time to review the game and write about it in advance of it releasing. If you're excited for the game, I would really appreciate your help in getting the word out!

I'll also be hosting a [release party stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_) on July 25th, 2025 at 18:00 UTC. Come join me for the celebration, developer commentary, and Q&A on that day! I'll also be showcasing the game at MAGWest in San Jose on August 8-10th. Feel free to come by and say hi!
