# ðŸ“… 2023, week 5

![exodrifter drifting asleep through a dark blue void](20230130054121-banner5.png)

Whoops! Time to cool off a little. I think I feel overwhelmed because of several reasons:

- I feel intimidated by how bad I feel about the _the recorded data_ and I'm still not sure what I need to do to make it feel better to me.
- I feel like I should upload my music to Spotify and the like so that people have more options for where to listen to my music, but I lose money doing this. I don't make much from Bandcamp either, so I have a hard time justifying it.
- I messed up redacting one of my videos so I ran out of bandwidth and I wasn't able to upload all my videos in time for this post.
- Over the weekend [I got a bit of assistance with my computer](20230128055428.md) to help my streams operate more smoothly, but there was a stressful point where I was worried I broke everything.

All of this combined makes me feel like I am doing too many things, doing all of them badly, and that I won't get anywhere. I spent some time this weekend trying to relax more than usual (I had a really good time seeing _Everything Everywhere All At Once_ in theaters this weekend and I think it is now one of my favorites), but I still feel a little dread from the energy requirement and difficulty of what I want to do. So, the schedule is a little light this week. I'm going to make up the inventory management stream I missed last week and doodle around in FL Studio for a bit, but that's it. Both of the streams will probably be shorter than usual. I may do a stream on Friday if I feel better, but I'm not planning on it.
