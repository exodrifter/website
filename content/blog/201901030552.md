Sometimes, it's easy to feel homesick for a place you've never been. A place where things are better. Unfortunately, these ephemeral places don't exist and it can be sad and painful to make them a reality.

Those were the kinds of feelings I had while working on this track. I would say it's a wistful feeling, but that doesn't feel quite right either.
