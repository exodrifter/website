# ðŸ“… 2023, week 3, and a release party announcement!

![exodrifter winking, with a star in the open eye, ontop of a blurred background of an fl studio project](20230115205216-wink.png)

There are no streams this week, but I do have a special announcement! My new album, _lonely metro_ is releasing next week on the 22nd. On release day, I will be holding a listening party on Twitch.

I've never held a release party before despite releasing around 16 albums on Bandcamp up to this point, so I'm really looking forward to it. The plan is to just hang out, chat, and have some fun listening to some old tracks of mine before listening to the newly released music! I hope you can join me~

Last week, I:

- ðŸ’¡ **Figured out a pattern for rendering arbitrary shapes.** This will make it easier to iterate on my puzzle game, as it will allow me to make items and containers of any shape. It took me a while to settle on a solution on stream, but thankfully I managed to find one that wasn't too complicated. Tilesets are hard!
- ðŸŒŠ **Added new animations** to _the recorded data_. I was supposed to work on the dialog, but I ended up just making each of the scenes more visually interesting. [I posted a few gifs](20230114044402.md), if you want to see! The water is very relaxing to look at.

It is likely that I won't post a schedule for week 5 of 2023, but I may hold an unplanned stream here and there during the week. See you in the next schedule update!
