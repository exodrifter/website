It's my birthday, so that means a new album! I've spent a lot of time on a particular track in this album called _Voyage_ (you can read more about why I made such a long track [here](201811190403.md)). It's not the most amazing track ever, but I think it's nice to listen to. I learned a lot about myself making it and I think it's changed how I approach making music for the better.

The runtime of the entire album comes out to 45:13, which I think is the longest album I've made by far! I could be wrong about that though, since Bandcamp doesn't make it easy to check the total runtime of my albums.

Let me know what you think about the album and here's to hoping my album next year will be even better! That said, I have a lot of stray tracks lying around that didn't really fit so I may end up making a few smaller albums later this year as well.
