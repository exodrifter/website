Note that the Soundcloud link is just a preview/sampler of the entire 30 minute song. See the downloads at the end of this post for the full track in a high-quality, lossless format. If you've dropped by any of the streams where I worked on this track, you may already know why I've decided to make a track as long as this.

Before I started working on Voyage, I noticed that I had a tendency to give up on a track once I got frustrated with it. Sometimes I would finish tracks without getting to this point, but when I did get frustrated I would try to wrap it up and be done with it. I didn't really like this very much because I would often feel like I could get a better result out of the song, but I just didn't know how.

So, the idea with this song was to push myself to get through this barrier at least a few times. Originally, the goal was to make a song between 30 minutes and 60 minutes without putting in anything I would feel like was filler. But, since I decided I had enough by the time I reached 30 minutes and 1 second, I guess I technically accomplished my goal but not necessarily in spirit, haha;;

Anyway, I hope you enjoy! It's a `.flac` file (or `.m4a`, if you use iTunes) this time around because Patreon's size limit is 200 mb and a `.wav` file ended up being 303 mb big (also, there's an HQ download of the preview if you're weird and want it for some reason).
