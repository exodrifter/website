# Access Announcement

![](201708122200-city.png)

Access is a mystery puzzle game about special agents who work for a cold-case detective unit in a secret government agency called the Reykvald Intelligence Agency. Scientists working for the RIA discover a new procedure that will give their detectives a superhuman ability - telepathy. This new technology is called Access, as it allows their agents to _access_ information that other people in their immediate vicinity know. However, the ability is somewhat limited. Agents can only access one type of information and can't tell who originally believed it.

I originally made a prototype of this game at the Electronic Game Developer Society (EGaDS) Narrative Game Jam in March 2015. I only had 24 hours to make it, and ever since I've been itching to get back to expanding on this idea and making a full-fledged version of it.

I'm excited about this game because there are a lot of interesting puzzles that can cause the player to realize that not everything is what it seems and that telepathy, at least in this world, is a lot more complicated and untrustworthy than it would sound at first.

The prototype is not at all representative of what the final end-product will eventually be. It is also very rough around the edges, but if you are interested in checking out it out, you can download it in the attachments section at the end of this post.

I'll be working on this game in the next few months and you'll see updates and behind-the-scenes explanations.

A few notes for playing the prototype:

- You need to click to proceed past the title drop screens
- Once you decide to arrest someone, the story will go to the end and you will no longer be allowed to explore. Make sure you have the right person before you arrest them!
