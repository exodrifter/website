# ðŸ“… 2023, week 14

I'm having a Steam launch party for Gender Dysphoria on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_) on Thursday, April 6th at 23:00 UTC. Right now, you can wishlist the game [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310400/Gender_Dysphoria/) and the optional OST [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310560/Gender_Dysphoria_OST/). The game was originally released in 2020 on itch.io and you can still pay-what-you want and play it now over [here](https://exodrifter.itch.io/gender-dysphoria).

I hope you can join me for the launch party! During the stream, I want to:
* Talk about current events related to transgender people.
* Press the release button.
* Show the game running on the Steam Deck.
* Play the game and provide commentary.
* Talk about what has happened since the game has released.

This is also the only stream I am definitely doing this week, but I may do a few ad-hoc ones.

As an aside, I'd like to say that I've been pretty sad and busy recently (hence the absence of streams last week and the late schedule) and that I am feeling much better now. However, this week will likely be my last week I can stream for a while as I will be getting gender-affirming surgery next week. I am nervous and excited, but I'll be looking forward to getting back to regular streams as soon as I recover!
