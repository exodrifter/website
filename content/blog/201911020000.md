I wanted to post this track yesterday, but I'm a dumb who forgot, so it's one day late. Sorry!

Anyway, since it was Halloween and this track had a spooky vibe, I felt it would be fitting. You may have heard me work on this during the stream quite a while ago now, it's just been sitting in my "ready to ship" folder. HQ download at the bottom, as always.
