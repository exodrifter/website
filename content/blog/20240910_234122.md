# goodbye cohost

I'm going to miss cohost.

This will likely be my last post on cohost! If you'd like to keep in touch with me, you can either join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/arqFQVt) or chat with me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_) when I stream. I have a bunch of other social media accounts, but that's all I use; Twitter/Mastodon/Bluesky make absolutely zero sense to me unfortunately, so you won't find me on there anytime soon.

I have been migrating my long-form posts to my notes git repository, but I haven't gotten around to converting them into a website you can browse. I guess I should really do it now. Until then, you can browse then [on GitHub](https://github.com/exodrifter/logbook/blob/main/indices/blog-posts.md).

I also started up an invite-only game development forum at [forum.tsuki.games](https://forum.tsuki.games). It's very quiet unfortunately, but if you are interested and you like making or talking about indie games or [this resonates with you](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/why-i-made-t-suki/85/6), please feel free to ask me for an invite.
