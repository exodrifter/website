# Recent Updates

A couple of things have been happening that I haven't been super vocal about.

**Work has started on level two of Access.** I've run into some physical and mental health problems over the last month or so that stopped me from doing anything much. I have started building out one of the levels and most of the narrative content has already been written, so hopefully I'll be able to finish level two soon.

**My [website](https://www.exodrifter.space/) uses HTTPS now!** I've been wanting to do this for a while. For those of you who are unaware of what HTTPS is and why we should use it, you might find this [article enlightening](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https). Anyway, security matters!

**I have Soundcloud Pro Unlimited now.** I have to use that Patreon money for something! This means I have:

- Unlimited upload time
- Better stats
- Ability to replace previously-uploaded tracks with a newer version

I can also start making money when people play my tracks on Soundcloud, but for that to happen I need to have at least 1k plays per month. Right now, I have 15 plays in the last month... I have a long way to go!

Anyway, the Voyage preview has been replaced with the [entire track](https://soundcloud.com/exodrifter/voyage). Nice!

**I've been helping people out on the open-source [unity-python integration](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-python) that I maintain.** It seems like the most common problem people have is installing additional libraries, especially with getting it to work not just in the editor but in the player as well. This has been a problem [I've talked about before](201901122301.md), but I've opened [a ticket](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-python/issues/21) to make it more visible on Github and I may spend a considerable amount of time working on a solution soon.
