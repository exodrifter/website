# Yggdrasil: A Better Git Client for Artists

In the past week I've been working on a little side project I've been wanting to do for a while that one of my friends urged me to do after I ranted to them about it.

Most visual Git clients are made for programmers. They re-implement essentially everything on the command line and as a result, these tools are rather difficult for artists (at least in my experience) to use.

They end up being confusing, because they still expect the user to stage files, make commits, remember to push and pull, etc. In the end, most artists just want to know two things: What have I changed and are these on the server yet?

So I really want to make this tool a stand-alone cross platform application, but learning Rust (the language I would like to use) will take some time. Since I wanted to at least mess with the UI and UX before I disappear for winter break, I decided to make a Unity-specific plugin. You can find the results of what I created over the weekend [here](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-yggdrasil).
