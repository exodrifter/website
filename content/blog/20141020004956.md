This is development week sixteen out of eighteen for Glass Bubble. Last week's devlog can be found [here](20141012225142.md).

This week was as busy as I expected it to be, although for some reason I was able to make more headway on the demo than I expected.

Marlena finished most of the bar scene assets this week, so I decided to assemble them together. You can see the result of that below:

As you can see, the characters are not animated yet, but it looks really nice already! What is interesting was in order to get this parallax effect I needed each object in the scene as a seperate image. This was relatively easy to do on the asset side as Marlena already had each item on a different layer. On the other hand, I had really skimped out on using an actual parallax effect, and instead opted to use a perspective camera. This meant in order to make parallax happen, I had to put images farther away from the camera. But, since the camera was in perspective mode, this made the image smaller. Thankfully, Marlena also provided an image with all of the objects in the scene, so I used that to scale everything correctly.

Then, I stayed up too late that night since I was so excited and I added a bunch of ambient sounds to the scene.

Later this week I will hopefully meet up with Jacques to record the voice overs for Daedor and Pik. When we met last week, he seemed very excited about the whole thing (in particular, the fact that he will be speaking a made-up language), so that makes me happy. Additionally, the rest of the hardware I need to record audio (pop filter and usb to mini usb cable) came in this week.
