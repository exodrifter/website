# Was in the ER again...

Last weekend I was starting to have trouble breathing again, so I saw a doctor about it and was prescribed more medicine. However, none of that seemed to work and a few days later I ended up in the ER again on the 12th.

Sigh.

I got diagnosed with pneumonia. I got prescribed medicine that would be better at treating it and I've been spending a lot of time resting and trying to recover. It seems like my asthma is getting worse recently, so it looks like I'll have to see an allergist to find out what it is I'm allergic to exactly and find ways to mitigate the danger.

Anyway, I am feeling better now even though it's only been a few days and I hope I can return to making updates again soon. I hope y'all are having a better time than me right now!
