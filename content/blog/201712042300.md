# Access Liars Models

The first level in Access - Liars - is fully furnished now! The models were completed at some point last week. They were all created in Blender, here are some screenshots:

As you can see, the models are pretty simple. This matches the minimalist style of the game and it makes it easier to make the game run well on mobile phones.
