# \#end;

It's my birthday, and you know what that means? I've just released [a new album](http://exodrifter.bandcamp.com/album/end)! Let me know what you think!

This year's album is pretty short, unfortunately. It seems like it got harder for me to make music, but the quality has risen a bit I think.

My plans for next year's album is to try something a little different. I want to try making a single long track about 30 to 60 minutes long. That might be a little intimidating to listeners, but at the same time it's a personal challenge I've always wanted to do for myself.
