# Access Testing

Bridgette and I did some user testing last Saturday at a friend's place. To celebrate our first playtest, we made _Aebleskiver_ (Danish Pancake Balls)! Testing was pretty boring, because, you know, watching someone play a largely text-based game is _riveting_. However, we did get a lot of feedback such as:

- The game is a little too open-ended
- We should add more "progress" markers for the player
- Evidence is more subtle than it should be
- Bugs!

Anyway, enjoy this behind-the-scenes video, which is, uh, just a boring video of my mundane life. Also a cat.
