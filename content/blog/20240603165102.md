# backerkit launch

The crowdfunding page for one of the games I worked on, _[voluntary commitment](../press-kits/voluntary-commitment/index.md)_, in collaboration with Indiepocalypse (@PIZZAPRANKS) and Iron Circus Comics for an indie game bundle has finally launched!

You can find the crowdfunding page here:

And there was a Forbes article written about the bundle! What the heck?!
