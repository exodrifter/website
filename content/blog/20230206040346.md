# ðŸ“… 2023, week 6

[Last week](20230130054121.md) I lamented about feeling overwhelmed, but I'm happy to say today that I've done some reflection and came to a conclusion about what I should change to be happier and more productive. ðŸ’¡

I realized two different things:

- I have learned a lot from making music and releasing an album every year, trying my best to release something regularly and posting it regardless of how good I think it is, but I had failed to apply this lesson to game development.
- The context switching I currently do means that I feel like I get less done and I feel less satisfied about my work.

So, I have decided that I should instead focus on one thing at a time for now and focus on getting that completed before moving onto the next thing. This means that, at the moment, I will be focusing on getting _Gender Dysphoria_ released on Steam and I plan to spend the next few weeks working on that. The tentative plan after that is to work on _the recorded data_, then make a music video, then work on _flambe_, then make a song with non-cringe lyrics. This also means that it's possible I won't actually release a music album next year on time like I normally do, since I want to focus more on game development for now.

On another note (and to finally explain the banner image), my sister Shia and I will be doing a _Parkitect_ playthrough on stream. Last time I played with her, my sister made some ridiculous roller coasters while I wasn't looking and I burst out laughing. This will be the first time I have her on stream and I'm really looking forward to it. I hope you can join us!
