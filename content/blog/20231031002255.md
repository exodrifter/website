# main menu/options menu

https://clips.twitch.tv/TrappedOilyShrimpKappaClaus-vggCkypBRD6OwV4b

Implemented a main menu/options menu today in Godot from scratch and it was easier than expected to do!

Though, I did run into a "fun" issue where updating a theme like setting a font doesn't update the scene view right away for things using the default theme. If you update the default theme in Godot, you'll have to reload the scene before you can see changes take effect.
