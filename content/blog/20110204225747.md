# Announcers

If you've ever played Stepmania, DDR, Technika, etc. you're probably familiar with that announcer voice. And boy, is it hard to copy.

I've been sitting here for at least 30 minutes recording myself saying things, and I only have 3 phrases recorded: "Combobreaker!", "Ready?", and "New Highscore!". All of them sound dry.

I think it's time to Google "How to sound like an announcer" (or something along those lines).
