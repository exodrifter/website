# Vacation

Hey skeletons (and everyone else, since this will be a public post)! I will be on vacation in the month of May and I want to get the most out of it. So, I will be refraining from making anything or streaming which will probably _kill me_ (this is hyperbole), but I have many other things I'd like to throw my focus to for a month that I'm also looking forward to. I might do a post or stream here and there but I might also do nothing at all!

I'll be back in June with more Twitch streams and... well, I should probably get back to posting more than just VODs on Patreon, huh? I'll keep that in mind. I've also paused the billing, so no patrons should see a charge for the month of May. See you all soon, and thanks again for all the support <3
