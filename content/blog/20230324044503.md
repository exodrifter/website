# All of the Sonniss GDC bundles

![](20230324044503-sonniss-gdq-2023.png)

You may have heard about that free 44 GB Sonniss GDC 2023 bundle. In case you are unaware like I was, all of the sound effects and ambience are royalty free and commercially usable with no attribution required and you can use the sound effects on an unlimited number of projects. You can see the license here: https://sonniss.com/gdc-bundle-license/

I looked into it a little more and found out that the past bundles are still available. You can get all of them here: https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc

Altogether, it seems that Sonniss have released about 205 GB of content this way since they started in 2015, which is pretty neat. If you're wondering where the years 2021 and 2022 are, the official page for this year's bundle over at `gdc.sonniss.com` says that they have been bundled into the 2023 bundle.
