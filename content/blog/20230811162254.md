Last night, I was streaming music production for the first time in a while. I've been taking music lessons and I've been excited to try and exercise some of the new knowledge I have learned about chords and scales.

I wanted to try writing something in a _Lydian_ mode since it tends to be used for mystery/enchanted music. I've been watching a lot of deep sea videos recently and I've been fascinated by things like undersea brine lakes and whale falls so I wanted to capture the mystical, mysterious, and beautiful feeling of being in the deep ocean, being surrounded by water that stretches in every direction, and not knowing what lies out there (but hopefully not in a scary way).

So, since I normally write in A minor I tried using A major and raising the 4th to make into a Lydian scale. I think this is called "A Lydian". However, I don't think I really accomplished my goal since I ended up playing A minor quite a bit. I also had a tendency to play A# with my A Lydian chords, which isn't in A Lydian scale, although maybe you could consider it to be a leading tone. At the start, I was expecting to transition to a relative minor of A Lydian or perhaps to an adjacent mode like A Mixolydian. In the end, I'm not sure what scales I ended up playing, hahaha.

In any case, I am happy to finally do music production again. It's been about a month since the [last time I did music on stream](https://vods.exodrifter.space/2023/07/14/1908) and a little over 5 months since my [last dedicated music stream](https://vods.exodrifter.space/2023/02/24/1914). It feels nice to make something new and I'm happy I was also able to finish something from start to finish in one sitting again!

I've gotten feedback that the song feels either intense and anxious or relaxing and chill, which is interesting since those emotions seem diametrically opposed. I can definitely see either perspective, and it lines up with what I've learned about Lydian having a generally ambiguous tone. What do you think? I'd like to know <3
