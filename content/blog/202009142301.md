Two weeks ago on August 31st I didn't stream because I was really depressed, but I still had energy. It's the kind of energy you have when you're angry, frustrated. It's different from what I normally feel and still feel right now: hopeless and defeated.

I decided to channel some of my energy that day into making a song instead of worrying about streaming and I finished it in a few hours (FL Studio recorded 2 hours 14 minutes). I don't really think this is one of my better works, since I feel like I could have definitely spent a lot more time on it, but I still feel quite satisfied with the song and I honestly don't really want to work on it anymore. It feels done.

I'm struggling to keep up with a lot of stuff, but I'm still going to try my best. I've been making a lot of progress on tool development recently and I'll have a special post to share about that soon related to Rumor. Likewise, I have finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my Vimeo membership so I can upload the VODs of the longer streams.

So, what I mean to say is that even though there are definitely good things happening in my life, it's still hard to weather the storm sometimes. That's more or less what the song is about, at least to me. I sincerely hope you skeletons are staying safe and doing well. If I don't forget it's Monday again, I'll see you all tomorrow on Twitch!
