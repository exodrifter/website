# 📅 2023, week 9

Last week, I wrapped up most of the hard work I need to do in order to release Gender Dysphoria on Steam which is a pretty great feeling. The steam page will be launching soon and I'll be posting more about it shortly.

In the meantime, things are a little chaotic for me now as I try to figure out what to do next. In particular, I'm planning on pivoting to a new top-secret project but I'm not sure if I can stream it! I've blocked out a time on Friday to stream, but what I'll be doing exactly will depend on how that shakes out.

I'm also giving up on making banner images for now since it's becoming harder for me to imagine different ways to make them look good with the limited time and resources I have. I think I'll just make them for special occasions in the future. Other than that, there isn't too much to say. Hope to see you in chat soon!
