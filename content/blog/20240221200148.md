This is devlog 9 of _lost contact_, a narrative-driven, hidden object game about loneliness.

Honestly, now that the game development is mostly focused on level design and dialog, I feel incredibly overwhelmed. Two months have passed and although there are four months remaining in my original plan, I was hoping to have a demo done by the end of the third month so that I could focus on marketing more than development in the last three months. Thinking about how I need to write most of the dialog, assemble all of the rooms, and put together a demo for people to play _and_ also somehow deliver the experience I want people to have has me in a cold sweat.

That isn't to say it can't be done or that it's undo-able, but I do very much feel intimidated and overwhelmed. When I'm not working on the game I feel like I should be and when I am I feel like I'm not doing enough. And, not only that, but I also have to spend time right now applying and getting ready for tabling at conventions and setting up a store page. It's... a lot. There's a lot to do. But, I'll just take things one step at a time.

There is new dialog and new rooms like the bedroom and mechanical workshop, but more notably the last large programming task, the inventory ui, is done. There was also a small visual bug, where you could see behind doors, that was fixed.

Anyway, if you'd like to hang out and talk with like-minded folks about game development, [my Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/arqFQVt) is still open to everyone. And, if you want to see how the development is going, I stream this game four days a week [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_). I'll see you all in the next devlog.
