Writing music with lyrics has long been a dream of mine, but for years and years I could never figure it out on my own. I wanted, earnestly, to write a song containing my feelings but I felt that everything I wrote was cringe as _hell_. So, [I made it a goal last year](20230117184206.md) and I started taking music lessons a few months ago to help with that.

I've been working on this producing this song for a while, to the extent that I missed my usual album release, ending my 8-year streak of releasing an album on my birthday. I feel like I've finally accomplished the goal of making a song with lyrics in it that doesn't sound immediately and overwhelmingly cringe (at least to me). I'm happy to finally get here.

I hope you can enjoy it. Lyrics below the cut, there's an HQ download on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/99769652), and you can find it on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/exodrifter/lonely-love) too.

looking for your text
pictures I took next
recall how it went
in my lonely love

x-ray, my mind
your gaze, those eyes
heart pierced, how kind
i cried, many times

things i would say back
you just had a knack
to know what i meant
in my lonely love

online, ghost touch
your voice, that sound
held close, so much
in warm tears i drowned

you say we never change
i tried to fix my ways
it can seem so strange when
things remain the same

online, ghost touch
your voice, that sound
held close, so much
in warm tears i drowned

you say we never change
tried to fix all my ways
but things remain
but things remain
