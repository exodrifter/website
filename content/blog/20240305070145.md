Writing music with lyrics has long been a dream of mine, but for years and years I could never figure it out on my own. I wanted, earnestly, to write a song containing my feelings but I felt that everything I wrote was cringe as _hell_. So, [I made it a goal last year](20230117184206.md) and I started taking music lessons a few months ago to help with that.

I've been working on this producing this song for a while, to the extent that I missed my usual album release, ending my 8-year streak of releasing an album on my birthday. I feel like I've finally accomplished the goal of making a song with lyrics in it that doesn't sound immediately and overwhelmingly cringe (at least to me). I'm happy to finally get here.

I hope you can enjoy it. Lyrics below the cut, there's an HQ download on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/99769652), and you can find it on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/exodrifter/lonely-love) too.

looking for your text<br/>
pictures I took next<br/>
recall how it went<br/>
in my lonely love<br/>

x-ray, my mind<br/>
your gaze, those eyes<br/>
heart pierced, how kind<br/>
i cried, many times<br/>

things i would say back<br/>
you just had a knack<br/>
to know what i meant<br/>
in my lonely love<br/>

online, ghost touch<br/>
your voice, that sound<br/>
held close, so much<br/>
in warm tears i drowned<br/>

you say we never change<br/>
i tried to fix my ways<br/>
it can seem so strange when<br/>
things remain the same<br/>

online, ghost touch<br/>
your voice, that sound<br/>
held close, so much<br/>
in warm tears i drowned<br/>

you say we never change<br/>
tried to fix all my ways<br/>
but things remain<br/>
but things remain<br/>
