# Tankmeld Stages

Stages are starting to take shape! So far, there are three complete stages.

The Snow stage is basic; it has a few obstacles and nothing special.

The Horror stage has moving crates that are spooky and push you around (sorry, no gif).

And the Lava stage has, well, lava. Lava will kill you.

I want to do at least one more stage for the game that will be factory themed. However, I am missing a match result and team selection screen, so I should probably do those first...
