# drew something nice after a long time

![a rough digital sketch of an anime girl on a blue background. she has long black hair, green eyes, and is wearing a blue hoodie. one of her eyes is open and the other is closed. her face has lines drawn downwards below both eyes all the way to her chin. she has an overall neutral, blank expression but one of her eyebrows is slightly raised. the colors are roughly shaded in, bleeding out of their lines occasionally.](20240214180551-pressure-avatar.png)
