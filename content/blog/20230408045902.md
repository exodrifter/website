# Gender Dysphoria v1.2

This game has been released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310400/Gender_Dysphoria/)! A few changes have been made for the Steam release.

**Added:**
* Gamepad support.
* A new command-line flag `--enable-all-accessibility` which enables all accessibility options.

**Changes:**
* Unskippable wait times during the disclaimer screens have been reduced to 3 seconds each.
* Ambience used in the Networking arcs contained a copyrighted track and has been replaced.
* The input prompt now reads "Press button to continue..." instead of "Press enter or click to continue..." so that it makes more sense when playing with a gamepad.
* Updated the exodrifter branding.
