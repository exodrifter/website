I feel somewhat satisfied this year. I still struggle a lot with mental health, but I feel like I'm making progress on getting better at making music and I'm happy to share these tracks with you. I even made a drumÂ and bass track, a genre that I've been wanting to experiment with for a long time! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.  
  
Well, I guess there isn't too much to say for this year's album. I'm looking forward to the next, see you soon <3
