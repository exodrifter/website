I have decided to stop paying for Soundcloud Pro which was $144/yr due to a lack of benefits for its relatively high cost. Unfortunately, free accounts can only have up to 180 minutes of music uploaded, so I had to delete a bunch of old tracks from Soundcloud (and will continue to do so as needed). This means some old posts that have Soundcloud links will no longer work.

Anyway, I wanted to make this track longer, but after listening to it several times, I eventually stopped feeling like I wanted to. I hope you enjoy it! HQ download down below, as usual.
