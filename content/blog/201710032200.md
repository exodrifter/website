# Access Writer

Hey y'all, just a short update: Access now has a writer!

Having a writer for Access is great because I wasn't looking forward to writing everything myself. I probably wasn't going to do a very good job and I thought it would also take me a long time.

But hey - we have a writer now! This will make it easier to bounce ideas around and make more significant and interesting progress.

You can stalk her on [tumblr](https://lipstickmata.tumblr.com/) if you do the tumblr things. You can also listen to some writing inspiration tracks [here](https://8tracks.com/tbridget/collections/access).
