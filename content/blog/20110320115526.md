# Slick Competition 2011

I was bored out of my mind over Spring Break so I decided to make a Sudoku solver. After a couple of days of inexplainable concurrent modification and null pointer exceptions, I decided to take a break and switch gears to making graphics for the sudoku game. Since I use Slick2D for practically all my games now, I headed over to slick.cokeandcode.com to see what was up and OMG THERES A CONTEST SINCE WHEN-

So there's this cool game contest being held, and it started on March 15th. Check out [this](http://slick.ninjacave.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3081) thread if you're interested. I decided to go with one of the pre-determined themes, which is "the sky is falling".

With my break ending so early, and with the impending school workload that I will most definitely get, I wonder if I'll be able to finish at all by May 15th. Meh, I'll manage.

I've already got down all the basic game play elements and such, but my one main problem is artwork. I either have to convince my pro-skills (relative to me, anyway) friend to do it for me, or I'll have to spend at least a week learning to pixel.

I definitely have a long way to go in terms of learning to pixel.
