This is development week six out of eighteen for Glass Bubble. The previous week's devlog was not written, but you can find the devlog for week four [post=34]here[/post].

As it turns out, I was not able to catch up as I had intended to. Now I'm a week behind, so intead of doing the work I planned for week six, I did week five's work instead.

Unfortunately, it seems that I'm starting to lose steam, because thinking about creating all of the assets for the game makes me not want to work on the game. I would still really like to see how people react to the story though, so for now I'll keep going and see what happens.

I finished writing Grim's script. In the game, I want to make it so that you can examine characters and objects. Grim has some flavour text of his own:
[script]
Dark, silent soliloquy.
Unspoken but known.
[/script]

Though after writing it, I realized that the style I wrote the flavour text for Kelsi was different. I'm not sure if I want to fix it though; maybe it's ok if only Grim's examine script is unique.

Next week I'll be writing the dialogs for Pik and Daedor.
