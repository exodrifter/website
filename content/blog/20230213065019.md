# ðŸ“… 2023, week 7

I had a bit of a rough week due to mental health, but I still managed to get some streams in and some work done, which I am happy about. I had my first Parkitect stream with my sister and I also got to spend a good amount of time working on preparing _Gender Dysphoria_ for release on Steam.

In particular, I implemented:

- A reduced wait time on disclaimer/content warning screens âŒš
- Support for any gamepad that Unity supports ðŸŽ®
- Detection of the control scheme for in-game hints ðŸ’¬
- A command line flag to enable all accessibility options â™¿

Unfortunately, many of the remaining steps don't seem to be well suited for streaming, so this week won't have any game development streams. Instead, I'll be spending time on my own getting the remaining steps completed. If I happen to finish everything ahead of schedule (which is unlikely), I will probably pick up doing music streams and maybe some pixel art again so I can make some assets for nme's website. But I might just take more time to relax too; I need to recharge!

Here's the schedule for next week:
