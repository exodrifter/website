# My First Patrons

Thank you so much, intrepid patrons! I really value your support and I will do my best to not let you down! Now, let me tell you what I've been up to in the last week.

I completed the basic [documentation](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/wiki) for Rumor and started showing it around on the Unity forums and on Reddit. If you don't know what Rumor is, it's a dialogue tree scripting language I created for Unity3D. So far, the reception has been positive and I even got some great feedback! I have a [few](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/issues/22) [more](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/issues/30) [improvements](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/issues/25) I want to finish for Rumor, and then I think it will finally be ready to exit alpha.

I also acquired business cards! See them below, I think they look pretty snazzy.

Lastly, some potential video game projects are in the works and I may make an announcement about one of them in the near future.

Once again, thank you so much for your support! It means _so much_ to me. See you around~
