Do you like anime, science, and indie games? I'd like to invite you to the t/suki forum.

You can sign up here: https://forum.tsuki.games/signup

I made this forum for celebrating the joy of making indie games, whether you're a fan of them or are interested in making them.

A sampler of threads:
- [Indie Funding Links and General Funding Advice](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/indie-funding-links-and-general-funding-advice/192)
- [Steam PAX West Weekend 2024 - Demos I Played](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/steam-pax-west-weekend-2024-demos-i-played/186)
- [t/suki book club - Before Your Eyes](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/t-suki-book-club-before-your-eyes/169)
- [How to make weird sound](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/how-to-make-weird-sound/182)
- [My review of PICO-8](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/my-review-of-pico-8/163)
- [cohost! appreciation thread](https://forum.tsuki.games/t/cohost-appreciation-thread/189)

It's a very small community right now and the forum is normally invite only. However, the cohost! community is chill so I wanted to open the doors, if temporarily, to anyone who is interested in joining. Public registration will close again on October 1st. I'll see you on the other side ❤️
