# godot lambdas do not capture by design

I learned this [on stream today](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1942014923). I was trying to interrupt a coroutine by using a lambda:

```gdscript
func foobar():
    var stop = false
    var stop_callback = func():
            stop = true
    stop_signal.connect(stop_callback)

    await get_tree().create_timer(10).timeout

    print(stop) # Always false
```

The idea here is that I wanted to call `foobar` to kick off some animation (like playing 20 animations with a delay of 0.1 seconds between each one) and be able to call `stop_signal.emit()` to cancel the animation (like playing a different animation for the same objects). However, Godot does **not** capture local variables. Instead, it will copy the value of the local variable. This means that if you try to modify the local variable inside of the lambda, it will be as if you have a new variable with the same name.

I am shocked and horrified, but apparently [this is by design](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/69014#issuecomment-1324017859).

One way to get around this is to use a variable which is normally copied by reference, like a `Variant`:

```gdscript
func foobar():
    var stop = { "value": false }
    var stop_callback = func():
            stop["value"] = true
    stop_signal.connect(stop_callback)

    await get_tree().create_timer(10).timeout

    print(stop["value"]) # Either true or false
```

Sure, that's fine I suppose.
