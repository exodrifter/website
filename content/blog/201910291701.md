This song is inspired by my ERP/RP experience in an MMORPG called Final Fantasy XIV. Specifically, this song tries to capture some of the air/mood of one particular person I've done some stuff with. Role-playing has been a lot of fun, and the new friends and relationships I have made there have helped me feel more connected and happy!

So, maybe I'll make more songs like this in the future, we'll see! HQ download link attached at the bottom, as usual.
