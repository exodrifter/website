# A return to tumblr

Aaaand Iâ€™m back. I will be using tumblr as a mirror for my blog as it seems I have some friends who would prefer to follow me using tumblr.

I will be uploading a bunch of posts soon and then backdating them. From what I understand about how tumblr works, this will allow posts to have the correct date that they were originally posted, but they will still show up on the dashboard in the order they were posted. So, sorry if I happen to flood any of your dashboards momentarily.
