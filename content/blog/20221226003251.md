# hello, cohost

![](20221226003251-welcome-to-cohost.png)

Hi there, cohost! I'm exodrifter (she/her), a space mechanic catgirl vtuber who streams game development and music production on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_).

I'm a little interested in how this platform will work out and I like the vibe that the community and developers seem to have, so I've decided to try and participate even though I generally dislike using other social media platforms.

Right now, I'm working on an inventory management video game about a dragon girl who is breaking down war machines into scrap to melt into metal bars for her treasure hoard in Godot. I'm also planning on releasing a new music album next month!

I have made a ton of games in the past, but the one I'm the most proud of is _Gender Dysphoria_, which you can play on [itch.io](https://exodrifter.itch.io/gender-dysphoria). It's a sad, personal interactive fiction about the negative experiences I've had since coming out as transgender. I wasn't expecting the game to receive as much positive feedback as it did, but I'm very happy for everyone's comments and I hope I can create more games that people will enjoy.

For now, you can find my completed albums on [Bandcamp](https://music.exodrifter.space) and links to everything else at [exodrifter.space](https://exodrifter.space). ❤️
