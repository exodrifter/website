# immediately buying synthv

I was hanging out on Twitch, dropping in on the streams of a couple of friends to say hi before going to sleep. I saw [JellyBearTV](https://www.twitch.tv/jellybeartv) using some voice synthesis software called [Synthesizer V](https://dreamtonics.com/en/synthesizerv/) that seemed more intuitive than Vocaloid to use and I was immediately hooked. Bought it within the hour and started playing around with it -- wait, I was supposed to go to sleep!!! ðŸ¥´

Turns out, Jelly had the same thing happen to him, which is really funny to me. He also saw it on someone else's stream and bought it immediately... Anyway, we're both learning how to use it now. Hopefully I can meet my goal of making [a non-cringe song with lyrics in it this year](20240305070145.md)!
