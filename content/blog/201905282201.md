# Access Dev Update 4

![](https://vimeo.com/573303904)

The playtest occurred last Saturday and it went really well! I'll talk about it in detail in the next dev update, which will also include the addition of these new sound effects in the game.

For now, here's a behind-the-scenes video of what it looks like when I record sound effects. I don't record _all_ of the sound effects for Access since some things are hard to recreate, but I do try to record my own sound effects if I can. After recording, I clean up the audio, which is what you are hearing in the video. I may or may not modify the sounds further in FL Studio to get certain effects such as reverb or pitch changes or if I need to put several sounds together to make a different sound, like the futuristic "lockpick" device that is used in the game. My partner and our cats helped out a bit too!

Equipment:

- Audio-Technica AT2010
- Presonus AudioBox iTwo
- Go Pro Hero 3+
