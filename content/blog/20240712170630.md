There are some cassette copies of Gender Dysphoria, a large QR code for the no signal Steam Page, and a boxed mushroom pesto sandwich.](20240712170630-table.jpg)

# see me at delta h con

I'm at [Delta H Con](https://deltahcon.com/) in Houston, TX, USA right now!

I'm in the offline games room (not the electronic games room, don't ask me) at table GH5! The hours are:
- Friday 10 AM to 7 PM
- Saturday 10 AM to 7 PM
- Sunday 10:30 AM to 5 PM

This time I have _no signal_ set up so I can see what players are doing from behind the table:

I feel like a genius, but this anti-boredom tactic only works if people are playing the game! So come on down if you can c:

Also I have free copies of _Gender Dysphoria_ for people who play the game, if you want them (just learned yesterday that I can't sell at this event).

Also, there's an F-Zero AX cab in the electronic games room. Apparently these things are insanely rare?
