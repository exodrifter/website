# 1GAM, first two months

It blew up. There are more than 2,000 game developers participating in One Game a Month including me, and if you don't know about it you should probably drop by [the site](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) and check it out even if you aren't a game developer. It will be amazing to see what people will make, and I'm excited to see how this events will turn out in the end.

For my January game I will be participating in [Global Game Jam](http://www.globalgamejam.org/). Since that won't be happening for a while, I will be working on rewriting my old game project Asterble with the libGDX library since I have some time before I get back to school. This will end up being my game for February. Expect a few blog posts in the future about the rewrite! :D
