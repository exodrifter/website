# So I Had This Watermelon

And there's this disgusting game I want to work on that involves lots of squishy, squelchy sounds, and it's kind of disgusting.

I had been putting off making sounds with this watermelon for the longest time, but since I'm about to go on a family vacation, I figured i might as well get around to it. The watermelon had been sitting in the kitchen for like, I don't know, a month?

Anyway, I made an ad-hoc recording situation in my kitchen and here's the resulting aftermath.

It was pretty fun to maul a watermelon with a hammer and watermelon got absolutely everywhere.
