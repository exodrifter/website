# ðŸ“… 2023, week 10

Last week, I started working on a new games project. I figured out how to work with Godot's 2D tilemaps and lighting for my new game project, _null_! _null_ will be my main development project going forward (other than the [upcoming release of Gender Dysphoria on Steam](20230228023805.md)). I'm working with one other person on the game and it will be about navigating an awful bureaucratic nightmare. I don't have much to say outside of that at this time, but I do plan on getting a rough prototype done by the end of the month, so I have a lot to do!

I'm also having my 7th stream anniversary! I don't know when I started exactly, but I do know that my first stream took place sometime between February 1st and March 6th of 2016. This will be the first time I actually celebrate my streaming anniversary, but I'm not planning on doing much other than playing the games submitted for the [Chill Vibes game jam](https://itch.io/jam/chill-vibes-game-jam). I hope to see you there!
