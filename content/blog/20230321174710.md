# pipes

![at the top, there are three rectangles in a horizontal line with a plus sign inbetween them, with the middle rectangle being swapped out with a different rectangle with the caption "nice!". at the bottom, there is a rectangle with three sockets for smaller rectangles and last two of the smaller rectangles are being swapped out for a larger rectangle the same size as the smaller two which cannot fit in either of the sockets combined with the caption "fml".](20230321174710-fml.png)

Ever since I started using Haskell, programming has turned into a spatial puzzle game where I try to fit pieces together and pipes are the best kind of piece.
