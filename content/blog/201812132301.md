# So Laze

![](201812132301-birch.jpg)

Birch is a pretty lazy cat who can be pretty annoying sometimes. Whenever I'm at my computer at home, he will try to lay down in my arms between me and my keyboard like in this picture. Then, he'll wave his tail happily, knocking around whatever might be nearby.
