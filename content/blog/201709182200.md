# Cat/Monitor

Two unfortunate things happened this weekend.

First, my cat threw up a whole bunch this weekend. He threw up 8 times, to be exact, on Saturday, but he's been fine since, thank goodness. He pooped some string the other day and I suppose that's what he was trying to throw up. Sorry if that's TMI, but you're just going to have to deal.

My monitor also died :c It started displaying after-images and something that looked like scan lines, which made it really difficult to read things on the screen. I've had it for about three years but similar monitors are surprisingly still pretty expensive. I had to buy a cheap replacement for now since I can't really afford to buy another monitor of similar performance.
