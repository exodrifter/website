# the blood draw

https://clips.twitch.tv/CooperativeCogentChinchillaTheRinger-4CGqDrOcbcvn5NMr

I got all of the remaining sound effects into the game today on stream and I had a lot of fun setting up this particular bit, where there's an:

- (Not pictured) A nice little ticking sound for the clock
- Announcement of the blood draw on the intercom
- Sound effect representing the blood draw

The blood draw is made using a few samples I recorded and some I found online. It uses a defibrillator, grapefruit squirting (?), heartbeat, empty drink straw sound, and an air pump.

It's alien and disgusting and I love it.
