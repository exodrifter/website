# black hole shader in godot

I finally finished porting a black hole shader to Godot!!!

The shader was originally implemented by [ebruneton](https://ebruneton.github.io/black_hole_shader/) in GLSL and Javascript. It took me quite a few attempts to port it over to Godot for my game, but I'm really happy with it c:
