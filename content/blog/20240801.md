I've been learning how to write songs with lyrics in them, the first in this journey being [lonely love](20240305.md). As you can see, I'm primarily concerned with writing lyrics about unrequited love or love that doesn't work out. Maybe one day I'll write more positive lyrics about love, but for now this is all that I've experienced so it's what I'll write. I hope you can relate to it.

I think this song is okay and I feel like I am getting better, but I need more practice. I'm looking forward to the next one. Maybe I'll even have enough music to release in an album next year in 2025!

coffee drinks are bittersweet<br/>
memories of you<br/>
addicted to another waking<br/>
moment of you<br/>

and then the sun sets<br/>
i have to work again<br/>
imagine shadows<br/>
to keep me company<br/>

hypnotic rhythm<br/>
nodding off now and then<br/>
it's all so breathless<br/>
a silent symphony<br/>

but days fly by<br/>
before my eyes<br/>
memories are lost<br/>

forgetting to<br/>
remember all the<br/>
moments with you<br/>

\[break\]

but days fly by<br/>
before my eyes<br/>
memories are lost<br/>

forgetting to<br/>
remember all the<br/>
moments with you<br/>

but coffee drinks are bittersweet<br/>
memories of you<br/>
addicted to another waking<br/>
moment of you<br/>

but coffee drinks are bittersweet<br/>
memories of you<br/>
addicted to another waking<br/>
moment of you<br/>
