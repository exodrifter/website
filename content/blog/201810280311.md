# Patreon Updates

Hey patrons, Patreon is changing things a little bit! As of this writing, this should not affect any of you, but I wanted to keep you informed. Â 

On November 7th, the posts you are allowed to see will be determined by your tier rather than by your pledge amount. Some of you are currently pledging more than what your tier requires, but not so much that you could be in the next tier.

Anyway, that's all for now. New posts and updates coming soon!
