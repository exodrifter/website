# Comfy Birch

![](202007191700-birch.jpg)

Sometimes Birch is so comfy, he rolls over and exposes his fuzzy tummy. It's enticing to want to rub his belly and he seems happy if you do it while he's drowsy. But, if you do it long enough and his drowsiness goes away, you'll quickly find your hand attacked by claws and teeth.
