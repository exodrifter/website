Unfortunately, last week's streams had a few technical issues, but we still had a good time and I think I've figured out how to deal with (most) of them. I've been talking with another streamer friend, [ZyeByteVT](https://www.twitch.tv/zyebytevt), who happens to have a similar setup to mine and we have been able to narrow down the source of our problems a bit together.

Here's a summary of last week's streams:

- üêç **Slithering around in _Snake Pass_**, as it turns out, is quite a [difficult thing to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv7SDtKKWoo). Surprisingly, I was reminded me a lot of _Getting Over It_. I ended up not liking the game very much, so I wrote some thoughts I had on [its design](20230102232039.md) and why I felt like it fell a little flat for me.
- ‚ö° **I switched from an adventure game to a puzzle-oriented one** for my inventory management game and I was able to make a puzzle on stream pretty quickly. This is pretty exciting for me, and I feel like I could finish a game with the new design much more quickly than the bigger design I would like to do someday.
- üéµ **The tracks for my upcoming album release have been mastered** and I also worked a bit on a new song. I'm not feeling that great and I want to have more time on my own to prepare for the release, so we won't have any music streams in the near future. There _will_ be a listening party on the 22nd to celebrate the release, so please do look forward to that.

This week, my streams will mostly be game-dev focused instead. I'll be working on:

- üß© **Making more puzzles** for the puzzle game that has-yet-to-be-codenamed! Maybe chat can help me decide? I might also work on an idea for allowing the ability to create bags or items of an arbitrary shape. This feature would be quite nice for iteration and to allow modders or level designers to create new levels more easily.
- üìù **Writing more eco-anxiety dialog trees** for _the recorded data_. I haven't worked on this game for months, but the artist for the game, [Titanseek3r](https://www.twitch.tv/titanseek3r), has returned to working on the assets which has made me feel excited again. Alternatively, I might work on improving the dialog system overall to make it easier for me to write. I have some ideas for how this will work... we'll see how I feel on the day of!
