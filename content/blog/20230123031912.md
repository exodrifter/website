# ðŸ“… 2023, week 4

If you attended my birthday party/release party stream on Twitch today, thank you for coming! It was a lot of fun to listen to some old tracks and the new album together. ðŸ’–

I'm still thinking about changing my streaming schedule, but for now I'm sticking to the usual schedule. No banner image this time, I had an exciting and tiring day! I even took a nice catnap after the party. ðŸ’¤
