# no signal v1.5.1

This build has only one change:

- Space is no longer a default input binding for interaction. This should fix the issue where you can inadvertently interact with objects while pressing space to move the camera up. 

If you have any problems with this build, please report the issue on the [itch.io](https://exodrifter.itch.io/no-signal/community) or [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2840590/discussions/) forum. On Steam, you can roll back to a previous build using the beta branches feature while you wait for a fix.
