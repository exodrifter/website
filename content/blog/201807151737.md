# Shortly after I started making music

![](201807151737-backland.png)

This post is recounting my experience shortly after I started making music. If you want to start at the beginning, read this [post](201804190802.md).

At some point I finally decided to purchase FL Studio, and I started to get more invested in making music. I started to try assembling albums, but they never were finished or completed. I took a look back at the stuff I made back then, and it seems like there are two albums that were (mostly) complete: _S.O. Project_ and [Backland](http://music.exodrifter.space/album/backland).

I don't remember what S.O. is supposed to stand for.

After listening to them, I decided that only _Backland_ was worth putting on my Bandcamp page. However, if you are so inclined, there is a .wav download of _S.O. Project_ that you can grab at the bottom of this post.

I never released any of these things in 2008, but in 2009 things changed. I started to post my music online, first on Blogspot, then on SheezyArt.com (DeviantArt did not support music at the time), and then finally at some point on Wix.

I was super overly-concerned about copyright issues back then. I knew that it didn't really matter since my music was so bad, but I figured it would be worthwhile to start developing good habits.

I'm not really sure where I read it, but I somehow heard mailing yourself copies of your music and leaving them sealed was a good way to prove that you were the original owner. So, I did just that.

I ended up only mailing one of them to myself. The other envelope on the bottom hasn't been mailed yet; it seemed like too much effort and I stopped doing it. I left the first envelope sealed until a few days ago. Here's what the CDs in both envelopes looked like:

This was before I legally changed my name; my initials at the time were DDP. The initials "RES" were for the made up studio "Reverb Echo Studio" that was supposedly releasing my music, which I used to brand my Blogspot and Wix pages with. I even had a nifty logo:

Anyway, I was really happy with the two albums I released in 2009 called [Erase](https://exodrifter.bandcamp.com/album/erase) and [Post](https://exodrifter.bandcamp.com/album/post-2) since I finally felt like I was starting to get a handle on things. In particular, I was really excited by one track I made called "Rebirth". I was starting to make things that kind of sounded like music! The only problem was, I wasn't entirely happy with the name I was releasing music under.

So in 2010, when I made noticeable improvements in my music, I released the album _Rising_ under the name Deramico. I got the name from mashing the words "Dream" and "Ico" together, but I didn't want it to be super obvious that I just stuck two words next to each other so I mixed it up a little. Even though I thought the name was super dumb shortly after, I stuck with that name until 2016, when I released _High Poly_.
