As always, there's an HQ download attached at the bottom of the post. 

I'm not really sure what to say about this track. I wanted to make something dark, brooding, and sinister, but instead it feels more like an adventure. It's kind of annoying that I wasn't really able to direct the emotional content of this track, but I still like it. Maybe I just needed to get it out of my system, haha;;; 

I was able to play around with a new synth that I recently acquired and you'll hear it doing what it does best: making metallic synth sounds. I'm really enjoying it and I'll probably use it more in the future.

Hope y'all enjoy! Lets see what I come up with next time~
