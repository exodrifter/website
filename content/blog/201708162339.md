# Rumor 1.0.0

Rumor has been updated to version 1.0.0. Â This update adds more operators and increases general flexibility. This is the first official release of Rumor that is not in a pre-release state.

You can download the new release [here](https://github.com/exodrifter/unity-rumor/releases/tag/1.0.0).

**Added**

- Added the ability to specify a clear for just dialog or just choices
- Added the default binding `_choice`, which returns the contents of the last chosen choice
- Added the `-=`, `+=`, `/=`, and `*=` assignment operators
- Added the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` comparison operators

**Changed**

- The `OnClear` event in `RumorState` has been changed to use a `ClearType` enum, which specifies if everything, just choices, or just dialog was cleared
- The Pause command will now wait for an advance if the time is less than or equal to 0
- Multiple methods of the same name can be binded as long as they have a different number of input parameters
