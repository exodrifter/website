FL Studio came out with a new synthesizer called Flex, so I decided to check it out while taking another shot at making music for Access. This time I finished the entire track in one sitting, which is super cool since I haven't done that in a while.

It's a little slow and builds upon itself but it sounds really good once it gets going and I'll probably use it as menu music.

The name is inspired by some lore from the show Sense8 which is one of the few television series I have enjoyed watching.
