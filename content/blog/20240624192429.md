# no signal @ Delta H Con 2024

![A picture of one of the rooms in no signal with the Delta H Con logo ontop of it.](20240624192429-delta-h.png)

I will be tabling at Delta H Con this year on July 12th to July 14th in Houston, TX. You can get tickets [here](https://deltahcon.com).

I'll be showing off a demo of _[no signal](../press-kits/no-signal/index.md)_ at table GH5! Wow, that sure are a lot of in-person conventions. It's before [2D Con](20240616051537.md) and [San Japan](20240623220847.md) though. If you live in Houston, I'd love to see you there!
