I'm not one to be too nervous, and I am not now, but I'm worried.

Tomorrow, I'll be going on a trip with my fellow computer science buddies to a competition that takes place a day later at UT Austin. I have not had a very good track record with competitions (my team got only 8th place last time we competed), but in the past few weeks I've been trying to actively prepare for the next competition. But, although it's going to sound like an excuse, I feel like I didn't have enough time to practice. Calculus homework has been hounding me all week and Government, as always, had assigned yet another mini-project.

So, I am naturally worried about my performance at the next competition, with the feeling like I've had a lackluster preparation for such an important contest. However, thankfully, this trip will prove to be very fun, giving me a chance to hang out and play with friends, which doesn't happen often. And by play I mean program.
