# Aziqua

So there was this track I made a really long time ago called _Aziqua_ near the end of June 2012. By the time my birthday rolled around in 2013, I decided to release a new album, but even though i liked it enough to post on SoundCloud I didn't like it enough to include in [_Back to the Void_](https://exodrifter.bandcamp.com/album/back-to-the-void).

On the request of a patron, I decided to find the old file, all of the old samples I used, and render it in case anyone else wants a high quality download. You can find the download in the attachments of this post.

As an aside, while I was digging around for all these old files I accidentally stumbled upon some old files. Like, really, _really_, old files. Maybe I'll write a post soon about how bad my music used to be.
