# Pathfinding Woes

![](201910280239-title.png)

Access has a pretty simple path-finding system for two reasons:

- Maps are simple, composed of static, rectangular rooms connected to each other via "doors".
- Characters have a set of predetermined positions they can be.

I thought this was a pretty simple task and I decided to not use a make a fully-fledged path-finding system.

At first, the algorithm did the following steps:

- Take the character's position.
- Find a series of doors that will take the character to the room they want to go to with the shortest distance possible.
- Pick one of the predetermined spots to stop at.

Here's what that looked like:

Simple, right? Well, I quickly ran into a problem with this approach. Consider hallways:

As you can see, this would cause a character to walk though a wall, which is... not great. The characters in the story are not ghosts, after all! Well, not yet anyway. A pretty simple solution is to give each door an entry and exit point.

Great! Here's what out algorithm looks like now (changes bolded):

- Take the character's position.
- Find a series of doors that will take the character to the room they want to go to with the shortest distance possible. **Use the assigned entry and exit points for that door.**
- Pick one of the predetermined spots to stop at.

As it turns out, having an entry and exit point for each door is pretty useful and I use it often to account for furniture in the room, especially for furniture placed near a wall. We don't want characters to walk through furniture either! By putting the exit and entry points in a place where characters can then make a straight-line path to any of the pre-determined positions in the room fixes that problem. So, here's where I am now:

Here's what's going on in this picture:

- Green boxes are the "predetermined positions"
- The yellow line goes between the entry and exit points of the door

As you can see, the lowest-most point on the door is extended quite far into the room to account for the counter, but we also want to place a character behind the counter. Our current strategy, doesn't know how to deal with this:

Whoops! That's not allowed. This makes more sense:

- Take the character's position.
- Find a series of doors that will take the character to the room they want to go to with the shortest distance possible. **Find the closest point on the line between the entry and exit points for that door.**
- Pick one of the predetermined spots to stop at.

This solution works surprisingly well:

And for other characters, it still behaves as expected!

If I run into even more problems and don't find a satisfactory solution, I may have to consider using Unity's built-in path-finding. I would like to avoid doing so since it would introduce a lot of complexity I think this game doesn't need.
