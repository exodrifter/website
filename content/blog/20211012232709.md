# Gender Dysphoria v1.1

One change and few bug fixes have been made as part of preparing the game for submission to IGF 2022.

**Changes:**
* Removed mandatory pauses except for the first one at the beginning of the game. These pauses were intended to help define the pacing of the dialog, but since these block player input and there is also no cue or feedback for them, they just feel like lag.

**Bug Fixes:**
* Fixed a mismatch between the copy and voice acting in the Pro Bono 5 scene.
* Fixed incorrect branching in the Phone 2 scene that prevented a branch of dialog from being reachable.
* Fixed a branching issue in Pro Bono 5 which sometimes resulted in confusing dialog where the game says the clerk is about to speak, but then the clerk doesn't.

Also, version 1.0 was skipped because that's what version 0.9 was supposed to be. I just forgot to change the major version number on account of the major update that happened in version 0.9.
