# collaboration with iron circus games

I can finally announce it!

The game that I've been working on since early this year is for a bundle that will have a crowdfunding campaign launched next year by Iron Circus Games. Here's the [official tweet from the publisher](https://twitter.com/ironcircuscomix/status/1702461505302638777).

It's a dark comedy adventure game with an open world where you meet other patients and try to navigate a bureaucratic nightmare of a medical system that doesn't want you to leave. There's a day/night system, patients have their own schedules, and lots of dialog that I still need to write! _internal panic_ ðŸ˜°

The game has the working title _null_ and I've been working on it with [evandahm](https://twitter.com/evandahm) who did the wonderful artwork you're seeing up there. I'm very excited to talk more about it and I have a few ideas for posts I'd like to make. But for now, please enjoy these clips:
