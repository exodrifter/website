Something that has always bothered me about Obsidian is how it can update the display text for a link, thus potentially changing the meaning of notes where the link was updated. This is a problem for me, because I want my Zettelkasten notes to be immutable, but if I rename my notes or move them around, the Zettelkasten notes are modified.

I think it is better if I never link to mutable notes from within a Zettelkasten note. To that end, I've removed all links to mutable notes in my Zettelkasten notes.

As an aside, I think this will reduce noise and make it easier to see relationships between notes, as I'm no longer adding irrelevant links from one note to another just because something was mentioned. For example, just because I mention Parks and Recreation in a note (see [20240603_020415](20240603_020415.md)), that doesn't mean I have anything in particular to say about it.

This goes against the original Zettelkasten article I read (see [20230529_0556](20230529_0556.md)), but I think this change makes sense due to my desire for immutability.
