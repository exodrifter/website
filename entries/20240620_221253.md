Trying to figure out how to fix the lack of mipmaps on `ViewportTexture`s in _no signal_ in Godot 4.2.2. Unfortunately, it appears that Godot does not generate mipmaps at all:

There's an open issue for the fact that the "generate mipmaps" setting is ignored for `ViewportTexture`s in Godot 3 ([godotengine/godot#23417](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23417)) and there is no such setting in Godot 4.

Naively attempting to use `Image`'s `generate_mipmaps` function is much too slow as it makes the game's framerate very choppy.
