stream 86 of _[no signal](../notes/no-signal.md)_:
- https://vods.exodrifter.space/2024/05/31/2035
- Added some dialog and wires to the storage scene
- Added a flag to the drive bay to auto-lock drives, so that players don't feel the need to eject drives and carry them around so they can see other chat logs.

It was a shorter stream, so I didn't get much done. But, I'm almost done refactoring the demo, so we'll be able to conduct playtests again soon. 

I don't feel like the dialog is very good in the storage room, but after I add a few more chat logs it should be good enough for playtesting so we can get feedback on the new narrative structure.
