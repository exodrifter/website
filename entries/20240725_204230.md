While working on _no signal_, I noticed that the hint bubble, which is added and removed to and from the scene dynamically at runtime, seemed to be changing the lighting in the scene.

I tried disabling the `GeometryInstance3D` property `cast_shadow`, but that didn't work. Changing the `cast_shadow` property to `GI_MODE_DISABLED` worked.
