stream 98 of _no signal_:
- Spent most of the stream fixing bugs in preparation for playtesting at Austin Glitch State
- Found an issue with the Godot debugger, where it shows the value `0` when a float is `NaN` ([20240627_214217](20240627_214217.md))
- Prevented music from overlapping with the cinematic or playing on the menu
- Tweaked the dialog and audio balance
