Something I dislike about my [Zettelkasten Notes](../notes/zettelkasten-note.md) is that it can be hard to quickly determine if it's a synthesis of something I read or saw or if it's an original thought I had. This makes it hard to know whether or not a note might be based on something when the source doesn't exist.

I should always include a value for the source, even if it's to say that there isn't a source.

Source: None
