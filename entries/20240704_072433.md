Had a conversation about the [lambdas do not capture local variables](../notes/godot-gdscript-lambdas-capture-by-value.md) issue in LCOLONQ's discord server. In particular, it was pointed out to me by `@liquidcake1` that the value of `Variant` variables _is_ itself a reference.

Before, I was mistakenly under the assumption that `Variant`s were passed by reference and other primitive values were passed by value, but with this explanation it is now clear to me that _everything_ is passed by value; it just happens that the value of a `Variant` is itself a reference. I think this design is less confusing than any alternative I can think of.

The documentation for Godot 4.2 is also consistent with this understanding, though it doesn't talk about how `Variant` values are themselves references:

> Lambda functions capture the local environment. Local variables are passed by value, so they won't be updated in the lambda if changed in the local function:
