_no signal_ stream 112:
- Digitized the notes from 2D Con ([20240827_210622](20240827_210622.md))

Docket:
- [x] Cards can lose data when loaded
- [x] Make up and down ranges for the camera look controls bigger
- [x] Change the names and descriptions of the card to be more clear; "Access Card" and "Comms card" seems like different things, rename to "Comms access card", add a description of what the access cards do.
- [x] Add changes are autosaved hint to card writer
- [x] Add card reader image when card is not inserted.
- [x] Add a comment about sequence a being like a "secure" password
- [x] Make lighting under rugs brighter
- [x] WASD bounds need to be bigger
- [x] There might be a mislabeled Elevator R drive?
- [x] Move comms computer off the floor, split the card writer to another computer
- [x] Add button to tutorial circuit
- [ ] Rework signal UI so that it shows the drive space requirements first, then shows a button to analyze the signal, then shows the signal and the transcript
- [x] Make labels for drives and computers more clear
- [ ] ~~Add velcro text to velcro mats~~ I think this would not look good. I think implementing an interaction is much better, but we don't have time for that right now.
- [x] Add logos to drives

For later:
- [ ] Find ways to encourage more clipping
- [ ] ~~Beacon search UI is hidden when zoomed~~ Not an issue anymore because you now have to press a button (which happens while zoomed out) to show the UI.
- [ ] Play unread notification sound when a new log is available
- [ ] Change encrypted error for logs to be more descriptive
- [ ] Support WASD in spin box
- [ ] Add a way to take notes?
- [ ] Add interaction with the velcro mat, use cloth items or add velcro strips to hard items
- [ ] disable look control in inventory, disable wasd
- [ ] Numpad doesn't work
- [ ] Update to Godot 4.3
- [ ] Game keeps forgetting the monitor setting
