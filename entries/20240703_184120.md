Yesterday on walaber's [Twitch](../notes/twitch.md) stream, he found out that [`get_contact_local_position`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/classes/class_physicsdirectbodystate3d.html#class-physicsdirectbodystate3d-method-get-contact-local-position) is documented as returning a global position and not a local position (See: [Twitch clip](https://www.twitch.tv/walaber/clip/MistyAffluentSalamanderOSfrog-mtx4jXJfb1tyN1QR)).

As it turns out, the Godot 4.2.2 documentation is correct when it says that the function returns a global position. Additionally, this appears to be intended:

> [AThousandShips](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/89938#issuecomment-2022364558):
>
> The documentation clarifies this, it might be a bit confusing but it's correct, it doesn't return the "local position", it returns the position of the "local contact", as opposed to the "collider position"
>
> This can't be changed without breaking compatibility, and the rename to "global" is incorrect, as it misses the meaning
>
> Changing the return value is also breaking compatibility, and is incorrect, it should be global
>

> - [PhysicsDirectBodyState2D: `get_contact_local_position` and `get_contact_collider_position` are inconsistent with 3D analogues #76050](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/76050)
>
> The valid rename would be to replace "local" with "body", but we can't do that without breaking compatibility
