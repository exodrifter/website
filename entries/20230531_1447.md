Watching [SGDQ 2023](../notes/sgdq-2023.md) and the streamer Lizstar is playing a game with a really interesting puzzle mechanic.

In [Dharma Doujo](../notes/dharma-doujo.md), the goal of the player is to clear the blocks by creating rows of a single type in the gutter at the bottom. This is done by hitting the left-most block in a row into a chute which will re-stack the blocks in the gutter at the bottom. If the row is all of one type, then the row is cleared and removed from the board. Otherwise, the row is pushed back up onto the board at the bottom. There's also a mechanic for losing if the blocks get pushed off the top or if the time limit runs out which happens when the crab reaches the top.

You essentially have to rearrange blocks until you can easily get all of the blocks of a certain type lined up in contiguous sections against the left. This is surprisingly interesting to watch and think about.
