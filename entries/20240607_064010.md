_Solaris (1972)_ is a science fiction film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Like _Stalker (1979)_, I found it to be rather slow yet beautiful (see [20240527_061339](20240527_061339.md)).

The film seems to tie the concepts of copies, reflections, and memories quite often. Burton shows Kris a recording of himself talking about the strange events on Solaris. Kris's wife Hari appears as a doppelganger, but is also based on Kris's memories of Hari. Kris and Hari both look at a mirror while Hari talks about how she doesn't know herself. Snaut helps Kris settle into his room by helping him make his room feel more like Earth. Later, Snaut even talks about how all humanity doesn't want to conquer the cosmos and that it just wants to do is spread Earth:

> Snaut: We don't know what to do with other worlds -- we don't want other worlds. Only a mirror.

He goes on to say that humanity doesn't actually want to make contact with an aliens species. We fear it and we don't really need it. Humanity just needs itself. At the end of the movie, as we see Kris apparently back at the home the film started at, the camera pans out to show that the place Kris is in is actually on the surface of Solaris. Solaris is literally becoming a copy of Earth.
