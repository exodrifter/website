Discovered that `Geometry2D.is_polygon_clockwise` is actually backwards.

```gdscript
func clip_outlines(outlines: Array):
	# First, filter out the holes
	#
	# Note that holes are counter-clockwise, but Godot's function
	# to detect clockwise polygons is backwards.
	# See godotengine/godot#49716
	var holes = []
	for i in range(outlines.size() - 1, -1, -1):
		if Geometry2D.is_polygon_clockwise(outlines[i]):
			holes.push_back(outlines[i])
			outlines.remove_at(i)
```
