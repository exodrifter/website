I'm trying to debug why avoidance doesn't seem to work with Godot's [2D navigation tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.html) example code.

I've updated the example code to use `set_velocity()`. This required changes in two places. First, in `_ready`, I need to hook up the `velocity_computed` callback:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	# This hooks up the computed velocity when avoidance is being used.
	navigation_agent.velocity_computed.connect(update_movement)

	# Omitted...
```

Then, in `_physics_process`, I need to call `NavigationAgent2D`'s `set_velocity` instead of `move_and_slide` so that it can be used in the collision avoidance algorithm.

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	if navigation_agent.is_navigation_finished():
		return

	var current_agent_position: Vector2 = global_position
	var next_path_position: Vector2 = navigation_agent.get_next_path_position()

	var new_velocity: Vector2 = next_path_position - current_agent_position
	new_velocity = new_velocity.normalized()
	new_velocity = new_velocity * movement_speed

	# Tell the navigation agent about the desired velocity
	navigation_agent.set_velocity(new_velocity)

func update_movement(new_velocity: Vector2) -> void:
	velocity = new_velocity
	move_and_slide()
```

After the collision avoidance has been computed, the new velocity is sent to `update_movement` via the `velocity_computed` signal that was set up earlier at the end of `_physics_process`and we can move correctly using the new velocity.

Important things I noticed:
* The `max_speed` property will clamp the magnitude of the velocity passed to `set_velocity` to the `max_speed` value.
