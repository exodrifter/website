<h1>About</h1>
<p>I love to <b>create</b>. Be it developing games, making music, or drawing, I love the process of creating
something new that people enjoy. In fact, you will almost always find me making something in my free time.
Aside from my eclectic interests, I usually like working on games.</p>
<p>I’m Darwin Pek, a software developer from Austin, Texas. I currently attend the University of
Texas at Austin as a Computer Science student. I am the President of the Electronic Game
Developer’s Society and I’ve interned at Chaotic Moon Studios and Twisted Pixel Games.</p>
