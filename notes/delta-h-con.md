# Delta H Con

Delta H Con is an anime convention held in Houston, Texas which claims to be a convention for "gaming enthusiasts" and "anime aficionados". It has panels, tournaments, artist alley, dealers room, events and more. I do not recommend going to this convention (see: [delta h con is a mess](../blog/20240716_delta-h-con-is-a-mess.md)).

I tabled at this convention on July 12, 2024. ([20240724_213535](../entries/20240724_213535.md))
