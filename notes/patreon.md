# Patreon

**[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)** is a creator [crowdfunding](../indices/crowdfunding.md) platform that I use. You can find my Patreon page here: https://www.patreon.com/exodrifter

I used to require a Patreon membership in order to view VODs, but VODs are now available for free on my VOD website at https://vods.exodrifter.space ([20240527_073527](../entries/20240527_073527.md))
