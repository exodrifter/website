# On Mars: Alien Invasion

_**On Mars: Alien Invasion**_ is an expansion for the board game _[On Mars](on-mars.md)._

## Strategy

- Try to get as few of the reusable tokens as possible so you can repeat actions more quickly ([20240601_051847](../entries/20240601_051847.md)).
- Ensure you have enough crystals to always use expendable action tokens ([20240601_051847](../entries/20240601_051847.md)).
- Don't prioritize getting blueprints, but if you get one get the blueprint that lets the aliens place corruption first ([20240601_051847](../entries/20240601_051847.md)).
- Place alien buildings near the humans so it is easier to move the aliens to points of interest ([20240601_051847](../entries/20240601_051847.md)).
- Try to place buildings every reset if you can. This greatly increases the available area for deployment later in the game. Otherwise, you may find that you don't have enough space to place aliens ([20240601_051847](../entries/20240601_051847.md)).
